    "Content": "<p>Updated March 28, 2023: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The Office extensibility \"get add-in\" button will be moved from the Insert tab to the Home Tab. We also aligned the extensibility experience across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams with a consistent logo and a flyout where users can easily find their installed add-ins while browsing the recommended add-ins at the same time.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Microsoft has a comprehensive extensibility ecosystem. You can gain access to a large number of our 1st-party add-ins and 3rd-party add-ins provided by our professional partners to enhance the capabilities of your Office suite. Today, we have over 2000 add-ins from various service providers to meet your specific needs, ranging from translation, bibliography, templates, graphing tools, multi-media contents, interactive components, and even professional finance and legal tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, you will be able to access all of these powerful add-ins via the FileMenu and Home Tab. The new location is accompanied by a new icon. The hexagon icon has been replaced with a unified square icon, which is consistent with other extensibility experiences across M365 services.&nbsp;</p><p>After clicking, you will see the flyout before entering the store, where you can explore the suggested add-ins, and if you have previously installed some add-ins, you can also have quick access from the flyout.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Preview: We will begin rolling it out in late December 2022 and expect to complete it by early May (previously mid-March 2023).&nbsp;</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling it out in early June 2023 and expect to complete it by late December 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This change will have no effect on the tenants or administrators. All previous store disabling settings will be respected and maintained. End-users using Word, Excel, or PowerPoint on Online, Win32, or Mac endpoints must now access the add-in store via the Home Tab rather than the previous Insert Tab.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There would be no need for preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
