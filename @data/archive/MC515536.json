Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">As a part of our extensibility vision and first release to Microsoft Graph, we are introducing three new APIs for retention labels, events, and event types in the Microsoft Graph beta environment. These APIs will enable you to customize and extend on what we have built in the product so far.<br></p><p>These APIs can be used by compliance admins and developers to manage retention labels in Data Lifecycle and Records Management solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=88276\" target=\"_blank\">88276</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Rollout will begin in late March 2023 (previously late February) and is expected to be complete by late April 2024 (previously mid-March).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>If your organization needs to automate any operation related to retention labels or events, we recommend you achieve this by using the new Graph APIs instead of using PowerShell cmdlets. With Graph, we use REST APIs that support better security, extensibility, and app authentication features. \n</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>The three APIs are available under the security node and the endpoints to access them are as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n<p>\n</p><table>\n<tbody><tr><td><b>Entity name</b></td><td><b>Endpoints</b></td><td><b>Solution</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Labels</td><td>security/labels/retentionLabels</td><td>Data Lifecycle, Records Management</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Events</td><td>security/triggers/retentionEvents</td><td>Records Management</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Event types</td><td>security/triggerTypes/retentionEventTypes</td><td>Records Management</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><p></p>\n<p><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p><i>Permissions</i></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>Currently, these APIs are supported through delegated permissions only, which are managed through the Graph interface. We are introducing two new permissions which you will need to access these APIs:<br></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>recordsmanagement.read.all<br></li><li>recordsmanagement.readwrite.all&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p><i>Licensing</i><br></p><p>Access to Data Lifecycle Management and Records Management features varies based on your Microsoft 365 license level.
