    "Content": "<p>Updated March 14, 2023: We have updated this message to show as intended. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The Stream migration tool, which has been in preview since August of 2022, has now entered general availability. The tool is designed to help IT admins migrate video content from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint). Admins can access the tool by logging on to the Stream Admin Center and then navigating to <i>Stream Migration &gt; Migration tool</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>As announced in January, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-stream-blog/update-on-stream-classic-retirement-last-day-of-service-set-for/ba-p/3712075\" target=\"_blank\">Stream (Classic) will be retired on Feb 15, 2024</a> for all customers, except GCC customers. The successor service Stream (on SharePoint) is currently available for all customers. A critical step to begin adopting Stream (on SharePoint) is to migrate video content to it. The Stream migration tool has been designed to help admins move content from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) as there is no auto-migration within Stream (Classic).&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=93361\" target=\"_blank\">93361</a></p><p><b>Note</b>: This message center post does not apply to Government Commercial Cloud (GCC) customers. The migration tool is not yet available for GCC customers, and we have not yet set a retirement date for the GCC instance of Stream (Classic). Until those dates are announced, GCC customers can continue to use Stream (Classic) without interruption. When these dates are announced GCC customers will receive both access to the migration tool and one-year advance notice of retirement.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p> \n</p><p>GA: We will begin rolling out on February 15,2023 and expect to complete rollout by late February.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>\n</p><p>As part of the Stream (Classic) retirement process we are introducing two default date settings which admins can adjust using the Stream (Classic) admin center.&nbsp;</p><p>How to delay the change that will block users from uploading to Stream (Classic):</p><ul><li>Beginning May 15, 2023 users will be blocked from uploading content to Stream (Classic) unless you take action to delay this change.
