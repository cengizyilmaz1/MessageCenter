    "Content": "<p>Updated June 13, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Users think about which tasks they need to complete, such as creating a survey, inside Microsoft Teams. Soon, app suggestions will be organized by tasks that the apps support as opposed to conventional categories (productivity, project management). As a result, the new categorization will reduce the amount of time users need to spend learning about these apps â€“ helping them to work more effectively.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=122527\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">122527</a><br></p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard: Rollout will begin in early Apr 2024 (previously early March) and is expected to be complete by late June 2024 (previously late May).\n</p><p>GCC: Rollout will begin in late May 2024 (previously early May) and is expected to be complete by late June 2024 (previously early June).\n</p><p>GCC High: Rollout will begin in late June 2024 (previously early June) and is expected to be complete by late July 2024 (previously early July).</p><p> </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>The task-based app suggestions will be added to the Tabs, Messaging Extension, and Bots in-context Stores. \n\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW14R3P?ver=8e35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" \"alt=\"current\" app=\"\" suggestions=\"\" categories=\"\" view\"=\"\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW14BuJ?ver=fbff\" style=\"width: 400px;\" \"alt=\"new\" app=\"\" suggestions=\"\" categories=\"\" view\"=\"\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p>\n<p>There is no action required at this time.
