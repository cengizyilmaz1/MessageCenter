Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are excited to announce a new feature that will allow individuals to customize the apps on the left navigation on microsoft365.com.

Users will be able to add and remove apps to the left navigation from the Apps page at Microsoft365.com/apps. Admins will not be able to manage or override the user's app choices.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1c8cr?ver=36ce\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"pin apps\"><br></p><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>No required preparation for this change.
