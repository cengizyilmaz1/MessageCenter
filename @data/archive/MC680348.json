We will communicate via Message center with a new timeline when available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">Microsoft Teams users will soon be able to create custom backgrounds for their Announcement posts with the generative AI power of Microsoft Designer. This release of Custom Backgrounds for Announcement Posts will be rolling out across Microsoft Teams Desktop and Web for Channels 2.0 in English – US markets only. Non-US tenants may have noticed a temporary loss in the ability to upload an image. For tenants who do not have access to Designer, the ability to upload image will be made available again in early March 2024. In parallel, the team is working to release a globally compliant and localized Designer integration in the first half of CY24.</p><p style=\"\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=123501\" target=\"_blank\">123501</a></p><p style=\"\"><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p style=\"\">Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-October and expect to complete by late October. - Complete</p><p style=\"\">Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-October and expect to complete by late October. - Complete</p><p style=\"\">Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November and expect to complete by mid-November. - Complete</p><p style=\"\">\n</p><p style=\"\"><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p style=\"\">Before, in Channels 1.0, users struggled to \"find the right picture,\" to \"find images that work correctly with banner sizing, so it takes ages,\" etc. \n</p><p style=\"\">Now, whether users have their own image or an idea in mind, or absolutely nothing at all, they can create rich, engaging backgrounds for their announcement posts through the generative AI power of Microsoft Designer.
