They will get a comprehensive overview of their BYOD rooms and devices activities. With this new addition, they will gain valuable insights into how these spaces are being utilized and enabling them to make data driven decisions.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=161728\" target=\"_blank\">161728</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out in late January 2024 (previously late November) and expect to complete rollout by late February 2024 (previously early February 2024). </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>IT admins will gain visibility of the BYOD rooms in the Teams Pro Management Portal upon logging in.
