Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams admins will soon be able to initiate private groups chats with a limited set of third-party Teams app publishers via a new 'Click-to-Chat' (C2C) feature being added to the Teams Admin Center (TAC).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=182034\" target=\"_blank\">182034</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Rollout will begin late November and will complete by early April 2024 (previously mid-March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>As part of this feature, Teams admins will be able to quickly communicate directly with app publishers to assess whether an app will meet their business including questions regarding data compliance, pricing and deployment. If an app publisher supports this feature, admins will discover a C2C button in the app card in the manage apps tab of TAC (screenshot below).</p><p>Note: if an admin has disabled external communications in their tenant, C2C will also be disabled. While the C2C button will appear, attempts to initiate a chat will result in an dialog providing an email address to which the admin can submit their questions outside of Teams.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1dJqx?ver=b359\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"C2C button\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1dJqA?ver=750b\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"send a message\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action if external communications are already enabled.
