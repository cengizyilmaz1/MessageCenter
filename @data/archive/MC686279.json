    "Content": "<p>Updated January 19, 2024: Customers in Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet can safely disregard this message. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p><p>We are transitioning the Stream experience in the desktop client of Microsoft Teams from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint). Once transitioned the Stream app in Microsoft Teams will display only Stream (on SharePoint) content--it will no longer display Stream (Classic) content. The new Stream (on SharePoint) app in Teams will feature similar content and features as found on the Stream start page.</p><p>The Stream app is currently accessible across multiple touchpoints on Teams, including the Stream app on Teams left rail, Stream on Teams message extension, and the Stream Tab on Chats/Channels. You can find the app by tapping the three dots on the Teams left rail and then search for Stream. As a first step, Stream app on Teams left rail will be updated to Stream (on Sharepoint). This updated version of Stream app will allow users to access the Stream start page within Teams, and quickly find and watch videos without switching apps. Users will have the option to pin the Stream app on the side panel for more convenient access in the future.</p><p>In the coming months, we will also transition the Stream app for Teams web and Teams mobile.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out early November 2023 and expect to complete by mid-December 2023 (previously mid-November).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>All users will see the Stream Start page when they access Stream App from Teams desktop client after this updated version is rolled out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
