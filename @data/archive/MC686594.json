These roles can currently be assigned either through the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal or through the Exchange Admin Center. Starting   February 2, 2024, Microsoft is simplifying Audit permissions management by ensuring you can manage access to Audit in accordance with your other Purview permissions controls directly from the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal. The ability to manage Audit permissions from Exchange Admin Center will cease to be available starting February 2, 2024. We recommend that you start using the Purview Compliance portal to manage Audit permissions and familiarize yourselves with the new permission controls. To minimize impact to your organization, all existing Audit permissions currently assigned in the Exchange Admin Center will be automatically configured in the Purview Compliance portal on February 2, 2024.      \n</p><p>You can learn more about the new permission controls at <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/audit-standard-setup#step-2-assign-permissions-to-search-the-audit-log\" target=\"_blank\">Set up Audit (Standard) in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting   February 2, 2024, Microsoft is simplifying Audit permissions management by ensuring you can manage access to Audit within the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal.
