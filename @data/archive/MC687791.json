We will communicate via Message center with a new timeline when available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">Microsoft Teams users will soon be able to create custom backgrounds for their Announcement posts with the generative AI power of Microsoft Designer. As part of the advanced Teams Premium capabilities, users will have access to DALL-E, a text to image generator, which they can use for their backgrounds. This release of Custom Backgrounds for Announcement Posts will be rolling out across Microsoft Teams Desktop and Web for Channels 2.0 in English – US markets only. Non-US tenants may have noticed a temporary loss in the ability to upload an image. For tenants who do not have access to Designer, the ability to upload image will be made available again in early March 2024. In parallel, the team is working to release a globally compliant and localized Designer integration in the first half of CY24.</p><p style=\"\"><b>Note: </b>Non-US tenants may notice a temporary loss in the ability to upload an image.
