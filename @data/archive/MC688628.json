We have expanded coverage to almost all search applications, including Outlook, Teams, and Windows Search! Other improvements provide deeper insights and filtering capabilities for search adoption across search applications and user segments like geography, department, and occupation. The goal is to give you a good insight into adoption of search and to identify adoption gaps for specific search applications, geographies, or departments.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=177894\" target=\"_blank\">177894</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out early November 2023 and expect to complete by late November 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>You will have a better opportunity to analyze search adoption and search activity in regions, departments and occupations across all your search applications.
