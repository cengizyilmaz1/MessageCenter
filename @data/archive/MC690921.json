Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">With \"Voice isolation\", you can enjoy clear and uninterrupted calls or meetings, no matter where you are. This feature uses AI to filter out all background noise, including other people's voices. By leveraging your voice profile, this advance noise suppression capability ensures only the userâ€™s voice is transmitted. Whether you are in a busy office, a noisy cafe, or a crowded airport, you can communicate with confidence and clarity. \"Voice isolation\" is powered by our advanced deep learning, speech services, and audio processing technology, and it shows our dedication to solving user problems with AI and enhancing audio quality and experience.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=125387\" target=\"_blank\">125387</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early March 2024 (previously early February) and expect to complete by mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February).</p><p>Standard Release and GCC: We will begin rolling out late March 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by early April 2024 (previously early March).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The Voice isolation feature will be enabled by default for your organization.
