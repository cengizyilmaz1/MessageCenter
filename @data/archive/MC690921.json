Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">With \"Voice isolation\", you can enjoy clear and uninterrupted calls or meetings, no matter where you are. This feature uses AI to filter out all background noise, including other people's voices. By leveraging your voice profile, this advance noise suppression capability ensures only the userâ€™s voice is transmitted. Whether you are in a busy office, a noisy cafe, or a crowded airport, you can communicate with confidence and clarity. \"Voice isolation\" is powered by our advanced deep learning, speech services, and audio processing technology, and it shows our dedication to solving user problems with AI and enhancing audio quality and experience.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=125387\" target=\"_blank\">125387</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 (previously early March) and expect to complete by mid-April 2024 (previously mid-March).</p><p>Standard Release and GCC: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The Voice isolation feature will be enabled by default for your organization.
