The videos will play inline for recipients within the same organization, meaning you will not have to leave Outlook to watch the video. Recipients outside the organization, and those not using the new Outlook or web, will see a link to the video which they can watch in the Stream web app (depending on the organization’s file sharing settings).</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n\n<p>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p><p>A new policy controls the ability to preview and playback Stream videos in Microsoft 365 applications including in Outlook and the Loop application.\n</p><p>If you enable or do not configure this policy setting, users will be able to preview and playback Stream videos within supported Microsoft 365 applications.\n</p><p>If you disable this policy setting, users will not be able to preview and playback Stream videos within supported Microsoft 365 applications, however, users will be able to open Stream video links in the Stream Web Application.\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> This policy setting only applies to Outlook and Loop applications.</p><p> \n</p><p> \n</p>",
