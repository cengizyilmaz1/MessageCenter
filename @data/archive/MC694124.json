Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">Viva Goals is launching this new team set up experience that enables end users to leverage their existing Microsoft 365 groups that they already own to create teams. The connected experience provides an effortless way for team owners to leverage the group membership and policy settings used commonly by Teams, SharePoint and other cloud apps. With this Microsoft 365 group-connected Viva Goals Teams experience, users will be able to also set their team` Viva Goals content as restricted and protect their team OKRs from unintended access.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=165682\" target=\"_blank\">165682</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out in late January 2024 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by early-February 2024 (previously late January).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Viva Goals will save time in creating teams from scratch and adding members to it as they can quickly use their existing groups to create teams in just a click.
