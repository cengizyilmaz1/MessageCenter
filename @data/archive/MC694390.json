SMS notifications include the date and time of the Teams Virtual Appointment and a shortened join URL. The external customer can opt out to all text messages for all Teams Virtual Appointments by replying 'STOP' to the text message. They can opt back in at any time by replying 'START'.</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>If you do not want users within your tenant to be able to access the SMS text notification feature in the Virtual Appointment Teams Meeting Template, you can implement a user-level policy via PowerShell to restrict access to this feature. You may consider updating your training and documentation as appropriate.</p>",
