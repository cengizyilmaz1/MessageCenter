In the interim, we have completed one time migration of Teams, contacts to outlook contact store but any changes in Outlook will not reflect in Teams and vice versa. This will be enabled in next steps for this effort. Please stay tuned for further updates on this via the message center post.</p><p style=\"\">Today, users can see Outlook contacts created with their Entra ID (AAD) account in Teams, but contacts created in Teams are not available in Outlook. To provide a consistent experience we are making changes to allow Teams contacts, created with a user's&nbsp;Entra ID (AAD) account, to be visible in Outlook as well.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will provide updates when we are ready to proceed.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><p>Once this change is complete, users will be able to see created contacts across both Outlook and Teams and vice versa.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b><br></p><p>You may consider updating your training and documentation as appropriate.</p>",
