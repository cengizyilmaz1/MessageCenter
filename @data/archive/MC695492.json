Here, you can input an accessibility title, and specify which rows or columns function as headers. This is useful to screen reader users because it allows them to know how your data is categorized. You can see this menu in Figure 1 below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1fcWs?ver=120f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>When you apply a style to your table, the rows and columns that function as headers in that style are marked accordingly automatically. You can give your table an accessibility label to communicate context of your table. This label will only surface when read aloud by the screen reader. Both features can be seen implemented in figure 2 below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1f7TT?ver=4244\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>You do not need to do anything to prepare for this update, but you may want to let your users know about this improvement.</p>",
