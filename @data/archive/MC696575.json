Thank you for your feedback.</p><p>We will be making changes to Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) features in Excel.</p><p><b>Note: </b>If you donâ€™t use Power Query, you may dismiss this message.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Starting <i style=\"\">March 11th, 2024,</i> we will be introducing important changes to the Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) features in Excel.</p><p><b>How does this affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Any user who tries to use Power Query after March 11th, 2024, and falls under one of the scenarios, below, will receive a relevant error message.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;As we are modernizing the Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) experience in Excel for Windows, some of the Get &amp; Transform Data capabilities will require <i>Microsoft Edge WebView2</i> (<a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Edge WebView2 | Microsoft Edge Developer</a>) to be installed on the client machine. In the future, all the Get &amp; Transform Data features in Excel for Windows will require Microsoft Edge WebView2 hence we recommend installing this library now.\n</li><li>&nbsp;In addition, and to provide the best-in-class encryption to our customers, we are planning to deprecate the support of <i>TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.1</i> or lower in Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) on all platforms. If a certain external data source a user tries to connect to <i>only supports TLS version 1.1 or lower,</i> they will not be able to access the relevant data source via Get &amp; Transform Data tools in Excel.</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You will need to:\n</p><ol><li>&nbsp;<i>Install Microsoft Edge WebView2 run-time&nbsp;</i>for upcoming Get Data features.\n</li><li>&nbsp;Ensure all of the <i>external data sources</i> you use with Power Query <i style=\"\">support TLS version 1.2 or higher </i>- for Power Query, in general.</li></ol><p>Please Inform your helpdesk and update documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>For additional information, please refer to:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/7104fbee-9e62-4cb9-a02e-5bfb1a6c536a\" target=\"_blank\">About Get &amp; Transform (Power Query) in Excel</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365\" target=\"_blank\">Preparing for TLS 1.2 in Office 365 and Office 365 GCC | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2-client\" target=\"_blank\">How to enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 on clients - Configuration Manager | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul>",
