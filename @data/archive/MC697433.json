    "Content": "<p>Updated September 30, 2024: Chrome will no longer be rolling out this change to general availability. Users will instead be able to choose whether they would like to enable privacy sandboxing. Read more about their update here: <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-update/\" target=\"_blank\">A new path for Privacy Sandbox on the web</a>.

This will impact some Teams experiences in Chrome. The recommendation is to use the Teams desktop client if you are part of the rollout cohort.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Starting in January 2024 and continuing through the remainder of 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Teams users who are using Google Chrome with this recent change will start seeing the following experiences:</p><ul><li>The new Teams web app will display a banner and require users to click it every 24 hours to remain signed in.
