To align experiences for Viva Engage users and to extend the value of new developments to a wider audience, we are extending updates to topic picking to all networks that have been migrated to use Topics in Viva. \n</p><p>Last year, we announced the General Availability of Topics for Viva Engage. In support of this change, topic migrations began for Viva Engage networks in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/overview-native-mode\" target=\"_blank\">Native mode</a> and will continue until all Viva Engage networks have migrated to use Topics in Viva. The migration to Topics in Viva creates a consolidated set of topics for use across Microsoft 365 and helps capture and share knowledge from all experiences using Viva Topics.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=374596\" target=\"_blank\">374596</a></p><p></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: Updated topic picking experiences will begin rolling out in January 2024 and will continue to roll out to all Viva Engage networks in Native mode that have been migrated to use Topics in Viva.<br></p><p></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>No action is needed from admins.
