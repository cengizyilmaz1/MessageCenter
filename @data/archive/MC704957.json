In addition, administrators are also able to select Copilot chats as a checked location in the policy creation wizard for any new or existing policies. This empowers administrators to fine-tune their management strategy precisely to their organization’s needs with a focus on user privacy protection. Whether it is setting specific conditions or deploying trainable classifiers, this feature provides flexibility and adaptability in compliance management, ensuring your organization's communications remain secure, compliant, and respectful of user privacy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gbqR?ver=1b25\" style=\"width: 500px;\"><br></p><p><i><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">Figure 1: New Copilot for Microsoft 365 dedicated Communication Compliance policy</span></i></p><p><i><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><br></span></i></p>\n<p>Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect business conduct and regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content.
