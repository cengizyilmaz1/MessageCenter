We have received feedback indicating that customers who use the Send Email flow perceive they may have overshared when they realize after clicking on the “Send” button that the default sharing link was broader than they had initially intended. This change helps to better align with customers’ expectations when sharing files with others, helping them share confidently with specific people in the most secure ways.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early January 2024 and expect to complete by late January 2024.</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2024 and expect to complete by early March 2024 (previously early February).</p><p><b>Note:</b> Some users may see this feature before others in your organization.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Users who interact with the Share control will be able to see this updated experience across all Microsoft 365 apps and in Web, Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>When you open the Share experience across any Microsoft 365 apps you can now focus on core sharing tasks: Invite and Copy link.</p><ul><li>Invite allows you to grant direct access to your file for the specific people you choose.&nbsp;</li><li>The name, group, or email you add in the “To:” field will receive an email invitation to access this item.
