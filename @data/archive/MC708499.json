Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">Currently, only Microsoft Teams meeting organizers can create Collaborative notes before and after meetings. We are rolling out enhanced&nbsp;Collaborative notes that allow any meeting invitee to create notes before, during, and after the meeting.

However, only meeting organizers can hide the notes once created. The Meeting notes will be shown on the right pane of the meeting window, and they can be opened in the browser or on a second monitor. Participants can continue real-time collaboration in meetings. When participants are assigned a task, they will also receive an email notification, synced with Planner and To Do apps.\n</p><p style=\"\">After the meeting, <i>Collaborative notes</i> will be accessible for all participants on the Teams calendar meeting details page. The Agenda, Meeting notes, and Follow-up tasks are a Loop component, so they can be copied easily into chats, group chats, emails, and other documents.</p><p style=\"\"><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gYZ3?ver=34a1\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p style=\"\">You can manage this feature via Microsoft SharePoint PowerShell with:<br></p><p style=\"\">Set-SPOTenant -IsCollabMeetingNotesFluidEnabled (boolean)\n</p><p style=\"\">Learn more about admin controls for managing Loop experiences: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/loop/loop-components-configuration?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Manage Loop workspaces in SharePoint Embedded | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p style=\"\"><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p style=\"\">No action is needed to prepare for this change.
