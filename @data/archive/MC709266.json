    "Content": "<p>Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Use any generic wired (USB-C and 3.5mm) headset for instant team communication on Android.<br></p><p>\n</p><p>Frontline workers often need to instantly communicate with each other even when their phones are locked. We integrated Walkie Talkie in Teams with audio accessories partners to make this experience possible with the dedicated push-to-talk (PTT) button on headsets, which instantly brings up walkie talkie for clear and secure voice communication. In addition to select specialized headsets, we are excited to announce that Walkie Talkie in Teams will now work with any generic wired (USB-C and 3.5mm) headsets on Android devices.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As long as the generic headset has a control to play/pause media or to accept/decline calls, frontline workers can use that control to start and stop transmissions on walkie talkie. Frontline organizations will be able to easily start using walkie talkie with these lower-cost generic headsets.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=369470\" target=\"_blank\">369470</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Standard and GCC: We will begin rolling out late February 2024 (previously early February) and expect to complete by mid-March 2024 (previously late February).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Walkie Talkie users can now connect any off the shelf generic headset with a play/pause or accept/decline call control to start and stop transmission on walkie talkie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>You may consider updating your training and documentation as appropriate.</p>",
