    "Content": "<p>Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Currently with town hall, you are unable to duplicate an event and create a new event based off an existing one. This can be time consuming if organizers would like to schedule multiple events that are similar to one another. To simplify event creation Microsoft Teams is introducing the ability to create a new town hall by duplicating the information for an existing scheduled one. Information includes a town hall's details, presenters, theming, and more. The organizer can also choose to edit and update the information as needed for their new town hall.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=376853\" target=\"_blank\">376853</a><br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete by early April 2024 (previously late February).</p><p>Worldwide and GCC: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously early March).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Town hall organizers in your tenant can now duplicate town halls from existing scheduled town halls.&nbsp;</p><p>Users can either right click on the webinar/townhall calendar object then click “duplicate event” or click on “duplicate event” in the details page when user double clicks the event on the calendar.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h8Jb?ver=2a87\" style=\"width: 200px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h0S7?ver=0907\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>You do not need to do anything to prepare; however, we do recommend updating your existing internal documentation on town halls to include this new update.</p>",
