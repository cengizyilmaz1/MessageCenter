While data showed this improved authentication completion rates for users, to comply with Meta's update we will be removing support for WhatsApp in India by March 1st, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Starting mid-February 2024, users in India who've been receiving OTP messages via WhatsApp will start receiving them via SMS as they did before. </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There is no action required by either end users or organizations. Microsoft will ensure all traffic is diverted back to the SMS channel by March 1st, 2024.</p><p>You may consider updating training and documentation as appropriate.</p>",
