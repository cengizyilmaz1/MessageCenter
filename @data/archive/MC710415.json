    "Content": "<p>Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Content camera support will be available on the new Teams app experience for Windows and MacOS. Content camera enables remote attendees to get a clear view of physical objects like whiteboards, printed documents, books, and more that are in a meeting room. Content camera intelligently detects, crops and frames the in-room object and shares its content with remote meeting participants. Even when a presenter moves in front of it, for example the whiteboard, remote participants will be able to see the content right through them.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=377670\" target=\"_blank\">377670</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Target release: We will begin rolling out in late February 2024 (previously early February) and expect to complete roll out by mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February).</p><p>Standard Release and GCC: We will begin rolling out in early-March 2024 and expect to complete rollout by mid-March 2024.</p><p>GCC-High: We will begin rolling out in mid-April 2024 and expect to complete rollout by late April 2024.</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out in mid-May 2024 and expect to complete rollout by late May 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>The content camera feature will be available to everyone in your organization, and it is supported on Windows and MacOS client.</p><p><i>How to enable this feature:</i></p><ul><li>Make sure you have a Built-in or USB-connected camera (specifically a document camera if you're sharing something on a table, desk, or other flat surface)</li></ul><p><i>Share a whiteboard using your camera:</i></p><ul><li>For this setup, we recommend you use a laptop with a built-in or USB-connected camera.\n</li><li>Start the meeting.\n</li><li>Click on “Share” button on meeting tool bar\n</li><li>Select Content from camera and choose Whiteboard.<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h4WU?ver=a586\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p></li><li>Using the preview screen to guide you, point your camera towards the whiteboard.\n</li><li>Place the camera about 3-4 feet away and center it with the whiteboard as much as you can.</li><li>When the camera detects the whiteboard, it automatically puts it into focus.</li><li>Select Share.\n</li><li>Everyone in the meeting gets a focused, clear view of the whiteboard.<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h4WW?ver=0f05\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p></li></ul><p><i>Share a document using your camera:</i></p><ul><li>For this setup, we recommend you use a USB-connected document camera.\n</li><li>Start the meeting.\n</li><li>Click on “Share” button on meeting tool bar.</li><li>Select Content from camera and choose Document.<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h9Wi?ver=b844\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p></li><li>Using the preview screen to guide you, place your camera above the document.<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h4WS?ver=615f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p></li><li>When the camera detects the document, it automatically puts it into focus.\n</li><li>Select Share.\n</li><li>Everyone in the meeting gets a focused, clear view of the document.<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h9Wl?ver=cd35\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p></li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>You may want to update your training materials indicating that this feature is now supported on the new Teams client.</p><p>Please keep in mind the following dependencies and limits:</p><ul><li>Blackboards currently aren't supported.&nbsp;</li><li>Users can only share one video stream: Presenter's face (via Me Video) or Camera content share.
