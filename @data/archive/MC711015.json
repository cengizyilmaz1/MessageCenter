Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Admins can now use the existing <i>Global reader</i> role for read-only access to the<i> Teams devices</i> section in the Teams admin center!</p><p>The <i>Global reader </i>role is a built-in role in Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;that allows admins to view all administrative features and settings without the ability to edit or modify them. This role is useful for auditing, reporting, and troubleshooting purposes.</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p>\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out this improvement in mid-May 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete it by late May 2024 (previously mid-April).<br></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Admins with the <i>Global reader </i>role can access the<i> Teams devices </i>section with read-only permissions to view device information like device inventory, health, history, settings, and use capabilities like download logs, export, filter, etc. They won't be able to make edits or take remote actions on the devices, such as restart, update, assign configuration, and remote sign-in/sign-out. \n</p><p>This feature provides a consistent experience across the Teams admin center and enhances the control and security for admins who need to access device information, stay informed, and monitor their devices without the worry of unintended changes.\n</p><p>To learn more about roles and how to assign them: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is needed to prepare for this change.
