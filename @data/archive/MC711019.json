Sometimes, even though the channel is not used, you still have it sticking in your teams and channels list. Introducing the capability for you to hide general channel, like any other channel in the team. Note, if general is the last channel in the team, then the team will get hidden as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=324840\" target=\"_blank\">324840</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early February 2024 and expect to complete by mid-February 2024.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High and DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by late April 2024 (previously early April).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>If general channel is hidden by the user, the channel will no longer show in their teams and channels list.
