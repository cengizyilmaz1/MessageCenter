With these updates, admins can see more details about the attachments that are present in the email that violated the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules, including name, size, and labels. There will be new fields for the attachments that are in emails when they match a DLP rule that will be displayed in Activity Explorer, DLP Alerts, and Microsoft Theft Protection (MTP) Alerts. With these updates, you can get better insights into the violation that has occurred even before you start getting into the finer details of the issue.</span></p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=369015\" target=\"_blank\">369015</a></p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>You will see more details about the attachments that are present in emails when violations occur.\n</p><p><u>Activity Explorer</u></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hr32?ver=1f37\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n\n<p><br></p><p><u>DLP Alerts</u></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hr2Z?ver=4b60\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n<p><u>MTP Alerts</u></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hr2W?ver=14d3\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><br></p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.
