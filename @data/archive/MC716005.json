Organizations can create label-based protection policies that specify which data sources, databases, or storage buckets are in scope, and which users or groups are allowed to access data with a certain sensitivity label and Purview will automatically enforce the policy and block unauthorized access to sensitive data. \n</p><p>Insider Risk Management extends its detection into multicloud environments by offering ready-to-use risk indicators in Azure, AWS, and SaaS apps including Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. Organizations can use these new indicators in data theft and data leaks policies.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p>\n<p>Information Protection admins can get started by accessing the Information Protection solution in the <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/informationprotection/purviewmipoverview\" target=\"_blank\">new Microsoft Purview portal</a>, to register, scan and protect sensitive information in their multicloud environments.\n</p><p>Updated string - Insider risk admins with appropriate permissions can opt into these new indicators in the <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/informationprotection/purviewmipoverview\" target=\"_blank\">new Microsoft Purview portal</a> or in the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Purview compliance portal</a> at Insider Risk Management settings.\n</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations.
