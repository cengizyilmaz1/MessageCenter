When you start typing in the search box, you will notice that Viva Connections is already selected and highlighted (screenshot 1). When you press Enter, you will go to a workplace search like you may have experienced on your organization’s intranet (screenshot 2). If you’d rather search within Teams, deselect the highlighted element (screenshot 1) and search again.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hxYS?ver=4a84\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hxYP?ver=909a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\"></p><p>To exit search, select the Viva Connections button in the app bar on the left to access the Viva Connections navigation, switch to another app with the app bar buttons in Teams, or use the back button in your browser in Teams for the web or the &lt; &gt; navigation in Teams for desktop.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If your organization is using New Teams, no action is needed to prepare for this rollout.
