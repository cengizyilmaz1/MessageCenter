Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows will be managed using a PowerShell script.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by late February 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With this change, you can separately manage Microsoft Search in Bing and Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows for your organization. Previously, a single control was on the <i>Search &amp; intelligence </i>page for Microsoft Search in Bing and Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows.\n</p><p>In the Microsoft admin center, the control for Microsoft Search in Bing will stay on the <i>Search &amp; intelligence</i> page. Your current selection with the single control will be inherited after this release.\n</p><p>Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows will no longer have a control in the Microsoft admin center. Instead, a PowerShell script will be available to manage it. If you have Copilot for Microsoft 365, your current selection with the single control will be inherited after this release. If you purchase Copilot for Microsoft 365 later, Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows will be enabled and you can manage it with the PowerShell script.\n</p><p>Note: If you have Copilot for Microsoft 365 and would like your users to access it from Bing, Edge, or Windows, you will need to ensure Copilot is turned on with the PowerShell script. This will enable Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing.com, copilot.microsoft.com, Edge sidebar, Edge mobile app, Copilot in Windows, and the Copilot app. We recommend this for your users to get the most value out of Copilot for Microsoft 365.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>The PowerShell script to manage Copilot for Microsoft 365 in Bing, Edge, and Windows will be available from the following documentation after this change completes in late February 2024:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-page\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Manage Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 with the Copilot page | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>To learn more about Microsoft Search in Bing: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/overview-microsoft-search-bing\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of Microsoft Search in Bing | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
