If you use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) to manage user profile data like organization or manager data, the Copilot dashboard will be automatically enabled for certain licensed users upon launch. As a Microsoft 365 global admin, you can grant or revoke access to the Copilot dashboard to users within your organization using the M365 Admin Center. You can use the new admin controls to turn off the default access. \n</p><p><i>How default access is determined</i></p><p>Users who are senior leaders within large teams as determined by their Microsoft Entra ID (AAD data) manager attribute can automatically view the report. Tenants must meet all of the following criteria to qualify:\n</p><ol><li>The majority of users in the tenant have the Manager ID attribute assigned in Microsoft Entra ID.</li><li>The majority of users in the tenant are part of a single reporting line.</li><li>The tenant has more than 2,500 seats.</li></ol><p>For those qualifying tenants, only users who meet both of the following criteria are enabled by default:\n</p><ul><li>The user is in the top three levels in the organization.</li><li>The user has a significant portion of the organization in their reporting line.</li></ul><p><i>PowerShell cmdlets to disable default access</i></p><p>For more information about the PowerShell&nbsp;cmdlets used to disable the default access, view the <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home?#/viva/insights\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">Copilot Dashboard access settings</a>&nbsp;page in the M365 Admin Center.</p><p>What can qualified users see in the Copilot Dashboard? \n</p><ul><li>Insights that combine Copilot usage metrics with collaboration and sentiment data will be available to Viva Insights licensed organizations in the Copilot Dashboard.
