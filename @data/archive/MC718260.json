Users that are required to  register a passkey in Microsoft Authenticator will see a dedicated registration experience. Users whose organization requires specific passkeys from various vendors and manufacturers will be shown allowable AAGUIDS of the passkeys they can choose to register. No changes are expected to existing Conditional Access policies targeting security information registration.</p><p><b>Current:</b><br></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hBWH?ver=da48\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\"><br></p><p><b>New:</b></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hBWG?ver=8fa8\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>For more information on changes to Microsoft Entra support for passkeys (FIDO2), please review our previous message center post MC690185:<i> (Updated) Prepare for device-bound passkeys in Microsoft Entra ID (changes to FIDO2 and Windows Hello for Business)</i>, (November 2023).</p><p>No action is needed to prepare for this change.
