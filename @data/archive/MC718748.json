The new Teams is available for all customers today and is being enabled in stages as defined below. Teams Admin Center policy controls <b>will remain available until end of March 2024, at which point they will only apply to your VDI users if applicable</b>. We have heard your feedback; if we are unable to update to new Teams by the end of March, users will be allowed to remain on classic Teams until classic Teams is no longer available. More updates on the end of availability will come in the next few weeks.</p><p>We recommend updating your organization to the latest version of the new Teams at your earliest convenience as<b> all new feature development will only be available in new Teams</b>. Comprehensive documentation is available here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-classic-client-end-of-availability\" target=\"_blank\">End of availability for classic Teams client - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>To help you execute and monitor your transition to new Teams, <b>we have released a new usage report in Teams Admin Center</b> that will show you usage of classic Teams vs new Teams within your tenant. Documentation is available here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/new-teams-usage-report\" target=\"_blank\">Usage report for new Teams client - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p><b>Microsoft-controlled rollout</b>. If your policy is set to Microsoft-controlled (default state), Microsoft will continue rolling out new Teams on your behalf. There is one final stage remaining for this rollout option:\n</p><ul><li><b>New Teams Only:</b> Beginning early April 2024, all remaining classic Teams users will be updated to new Teams and the toggle switch will be removed. If we are unable to update to new Teams, users will be allowed to remain on classic Teams until classic Teams is no longer available. See End of Availability section below for more information. After this completes, Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams just once on your behalf after a small delay of 14 days. If this uninstall is blocked for any reasons (e.g. by machine configuration, etc.) the uninstall will not be attempted again and you will need to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/msi-deployment#uninstallation\" target=\"_blank\">remove classic Teams</a> yourself if you want.\n</li></ul><p><b>Admin-managed rollout</b>. Admins may choose to control their new Teams rollout by setting the Teams update policy for their users (as described in: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-deploy-using-policies?tabs=teams-admin-center\" target=\"_blank\">Upgrade to the new Teams client using policies - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>.) Admins may control the Teams update policy until end of March 2024. \n</p><p>Starting early April, 2024, Teams update policies you have applied in the past or policies you apply going forward in Teams Admin Center or with PowerShell will no longer be honored except for your VDI users, if applicable. When this change is complete, a Microsoft-controlled rollout will begin according to the following schedule.\n</p><ul><li><b>New Teams becomes the default app:</b> Beginning early April 2024, new Teams will become the default app for all Teams users. The toggle will still be available to users to switch back to classic Teams if needed.\n</li><li><b>New Teams Only:</b> Beginning mid-May 2024, all remaining classic Teams users will be updated to new Teams and the toggle switch will be removed. If we are unable to update to new Teams, users will be allowed to remain on classic Teams until classic Teams is no longer available. See End of availability section below for more information. After this completes, Microsoft will attempt to uninstall classic Teams just once on your behalf after a small delay (currently 14 days, subject to change).
