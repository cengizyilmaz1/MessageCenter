With this improvement, users can more easily navigate through their history and focus on what’s most pertinent to them.</p>\n<ul><li><u>Date dividers on desktop</u>: Following the same desktop treatment as regular Teams messages, if the message is less than one week old, we will display the day of week (e.g. “Monday”) in the date divider. If the message is more than 1 week old, we will show the month and date (e.g. “February 2”). If the message happened in the previous calendar year, we will include year (e.g. November 10, 2023).</li><li><u>Date dividers on mobile</u>: following the same logic that exists today in mobile chats, if the message occurred yesterday, we will display the “Yesterday” and time (e.g. “Yesterday 8:08AM”). If within a week, we will show the day of week (e.g. “Monday 11:02AM). If the message is older than a week, we will show the date and time (e.g. November 12, 11:02AM).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
