    "Content": "<p>Updated July 22, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>To ensure a consistent experience across all user accounts, the Multiple Tenant and Multiple Account Notification Dropdown will extend to include Microsoft Accounts.</p><p>We are addressing the feedback of the users about the account picker presence on pre-join screen in case user has one account and joining a meeting within a tenant. As a result, we will not show account picker in such cases. However, this change will take place only during Worldwide release. Targeted release users with one account will see account picker in case they have just one account and joining a meeting within the tenant. Please consider it as a known issue/limitation which will be fixed with general release.<br></p><p>Starting in April 2024 and rolling out gradually, the Microsoft Teams desktop app on Windows and Mac will let you use any type of Teams account (work, school, or personal). As in classic Teams, admins can control their usersâ€™ sign-in capabilities with group policies.</p><p>Users will be able to add and access their additional accounts in the upper right corner of Teams by selecting their profile picture. Teams personal account users can connect and collaborate with the people and groups in their life through <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/communities\" target=\"_blank\">Communities in Teams</a> by adding a personal Microsoft account (MSA).

Teams will allow users to view or change the identity that they want to use for meetings, right on the meeting pre-join screen. These changes follow all meeting privacy and security policies.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=383006\" target=\"_blank\">383006</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late April 2024 (previously early April) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously mid-April).</p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early May 2024 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously early July).
