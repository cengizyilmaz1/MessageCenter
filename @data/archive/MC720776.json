Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Starting late March 2024, admins can customize their organization's branding assets onto Edge for Business through the Microsoft Edge management service. This branding can help users signed in with an Entra ID (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) more easily differentiate between multiple profiles and browser windows through visual cues on the profile pill, profile flyout, and Edge for Business taskbar icon. Only admins can control, preview, and customize how Edge for Business shows the following organization brand assets:</p><p></p><ul><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Organization name\n</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Accent color\n</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Organization logo\n</font></li><li style=\"margin: 0in 0in 7.5pt;\"><font face=\"Arial, sans-serif\">Edge for Business taskbar icon overlay</font></li></ul><p>Default branding can be enabled by admins through the following policies:<br></p><ul><li>OrganizationalBrandingOnWorkProfileUIEnabled\n</li><li>OrganizationLogoOverlayOnAppIconEnabled</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=383013\" target=\"_blank\">383013</a>&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out no sooner than mid-March 2024 with Microsoft Edge version 123.
