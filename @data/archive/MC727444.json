If your tenant runs an MGDC pipeline between March 31, 2024, and April 30, 2024, MGDC will automatically migrate your tenant to the new experience during that pipeline run; during this time, no new PAM requests will be created. In both cases (one-click migration and automatic migration), MGDC will convert all your approved PAM requests for MGDC into MGDC app registrations and authorizations for the new experience so that existing pipelines continue working without any required modifications.</p><p>If neither of the above (one-click migration or automatic migration) occurs by April 30, 2024, your tenant's PAM approvals will NOT be converted, and you will need to manually use the new onboarding experience to enable your pipelines again after this date. </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Review your current configuration and make changes as appropriate for your organization.</p><p>Learn more here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/existing-customer-migration\" target=\"_blank\">Migrate existing customers to the enhanced Microsoft Graph Data Connect consent experience - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;</a></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",
