To align with the current Defender Antivirus platform update, only N-2 versions will be supported.</p>\n<p>Reasons:</p>\n<ul><li>New security intelligence update logic is dependent on newer scan engine logic. Many new detections wonâ€™t trigger for customers running an older engine version (such as from 6 months to 2+ years ago).</li><li>Newer Defender Antivirus platform updates might crash due to an older engine logic that does not comprehend new functionalities <b>such as newer code in a Defender Antivirus platform update that works in unison with the engine update or newer endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) service, and so on</b>.</li><li>We want to ensure you are not running an older scan engine version with a known vulnerability.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD, USNat, and USSec): The changes will take effect May 1, 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>To be fully supported, keep current with the latest engine updates. Our support structure is dynamic, evolving into two phases depending on the availability of the latest engine version:</p><ul><li>Security and critical updates servicing phase: When running the latest engine version, you're eligible to receive security and critical updates to the anti-malware engine.  \n</li><li>Technical support (only) phase: After a new engine version is released, support for older versions (N-2) reduces to technical support only. Engine versions older than N-2 are no longer supported. Technical support continues to be provided for upgrades from an older engine version to the latest engine version.\n<ul><li>During the technical support (only) phase, commercially reasonable support incidents are handled through Microsoft Customer Service and Support and Microsoft's managed support plans (such as Premier Support). If a support incident requires escalation to development teams for further guidance, requires a non-security update, or requires a security update, customers are asked to upgrade to the latest engine version.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Please make sure that you have a supported mpengine.dll version installed. Minimum requirements are version 1.1.23110.2, version 1.1.24010.10, or newer.</p><p>To check your engine updates version in your environment:</p><p>1.
