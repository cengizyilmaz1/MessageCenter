There will be a new toggle on the Microsoft Syntex admin page that allows admins to turn off each document processing service.  When the service is turned off, models of this type cannot be created by end users and existing models will be stopped from running in the tenancy.  If the service is turned back on, users in the tenancy will be able to create and apply models and existing models will be allowed to run.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
