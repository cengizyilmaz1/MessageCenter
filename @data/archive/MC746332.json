This setting will only apply when local files are uploaded using drag-and-drop in Teams chat and channel conversations. \n</p><p>This setting does not apply to Teams mobile and these user actions on Teams Desktop:\n</p><ul><li>Pasted images or media files in Teams chat and channel conversations \n</li><li>Files uploaded using the default attach file icon (paper clip)\n</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=376219\" target=\"_blank\">376219</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 and expect to complete by mid-April 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide GCC, GCC High, and DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-April and expect to complete by late May 2024 (previously early May).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If your organization is not using a third-party storage provider on Teams, this feature may not be relevant. \n</p><p>If your organization is using a third-party storage provider on Teams, admins can use a PowerShell command to set the default content app for local files uploaded using drag-and-drop in Teams chat and channel conversations.
