    "Content": "<p>Updated May 24, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Meeting Chat is shown by default in Teams Room on Windows in Gallery view, making it easier to see incoming chat messages on the front-of-room display. IT admins can configure the default chat experience for a room, and users can make in-meeting changes to show or hide the chat using the touch console.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=332424\" target=\"_blank\">332424</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General\nAvailability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out late April 2024 (previously mid-April) and expected to complete by late May 2024 (previously mid-May).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This update enables users to have visibility of a meeting chat on the right panel in Gallery view during a meeting. In addition to the layout change, the chat icon button to show/hide the chat panel is moved from the view switcher to the uBar.</p><p><i>Chat panel in Gallery view</i></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1jTea?ver=5a36\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i>Chat button on uBar</i></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1jW0O?ver=785a\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><i><br></i></p><p>\n</p><p>The default chat experience in Gallery view can be configured via Teams Admin Center or XML setting &lt;OpenMeetingChatByDefault&gt;. The default value is 'true.' Please note that the existing &lt;ShowMeetingChat&gt; setting hides the meeting chat completely from all in-meeting layouts as well as the chat button in-meeting. Therefore, &lt;ShowMeetingChat&gt; overrides &lt;OpenMeetingChatByDefault&gt;.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
