    "Content": "<p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: Direct Media Connection is a new feature that will determine the media connection mode for meetings and 1:1 calls. We are adding a new admin control for admins to choose whether to involve a relay or media processor between meetings and 1:1 calls.\n</p><p>If Direct Media Connection is off, a relay or media processor will transfer the media between participants in meetings and calls. If Direct Media Connection is on, we will try not to include a relay or media processor between the participants in meetings and calls. (Infrequently, if end points are not compatible with setting up a direct connection, we use a relay or media processor.)\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (all environments): We will begin rolling out early April 2024 and expect to complete by late April 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The Teams client will check the Direct Media Connection setting at the call setup stage. If the setting is False, the Teams client media library will not share the local IP address to the peers, which will force the media connection to be established through a relay server or a media processor server. If the Setting is True, the local IP address will be shared to the peers as a direct connection for better media quality and lower bandwidth usage.\n</p><p>Direct Media Connection is a user-level policy that admins can set as a tenant default or configure for specific individuals in their tenant. Admins will implement this feature with PowerShell commands.
