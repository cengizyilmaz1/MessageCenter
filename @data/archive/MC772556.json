    "Content": "<p>Updated April 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously mid-May).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late June 2024 (previously early June).\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 and expect to complete by early July 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Longer URLs for meetings scheduled before the rollout will continue to work. The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt;\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",
