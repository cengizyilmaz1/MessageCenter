    "Content": "<p>Updated June 6, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: We are rolling out two updates to app sharing in Microsoft Teams meetings.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=389844\" target=\"_blank\">389844</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Developer Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2024 and expect to complete by mid-April 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024 (previously late May).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout:\n</p><ol><li>Meeting participants will be able to share non-collaborative apps as a view-only experience to the meeting stage with one click of the small <i>Share </i>icon (in Screenshot 1) in the app panel. Before this rollout, only collaborative apps (like Microsoft Whiteboard and Mural) had the one-click option programmed by their developers, and non-collaborative apps could be shared only with the large <i>Share </i>icon at the top of the Teams meeting screen (a multi-click experience). \n</li><li>App developers will be able to use the updated <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library?tabs=javascript%2Cmanifest-teams-toolkit\" target=\"_blank\">Teams JavaScript client library SDK - Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> to update their apps so meeting participants can share a specific part of the app (instead of the whole app) in the Teams meeting. This requires less developer investment in comparison to the work needed for fully collaborative apps like Microsoft Whiteboard, Mural, Miro, etc.\n</li></ol><p>Note: the new features in this rollout are not meant to replace the currently existing <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/apps-in-teams-meetings/teams-live-share-overview?tabs=javascript\" target=\"_blank\">collaborative experience in Teams Live Share</a>. The new features can be implemented alongside Live Share if desired.\n</p><p>This rollout does not require user education, because the small <i>Share&nbsp;</i>icon and one-click sharing already exists. \n</p><p>Screenshot 1: To share an app, select the small <i>Share</i> icon in the top right corner of the app panel:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kbq5?ver=5ab9\" style=\"width: 400px; alt=\" user=\"\" controls\"=\"\"> \n</p><p>Screenshot 2: The presenter view (popped out) of a shared app:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1ke3e?ver=7c19\" style=\"width: 400px; alt=\" user=\"\" controls\"=\"\">\n</p><p>Screenshot 3: Meeting attendeeâ€™s view of a shared app:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kbq6?ver=1623\" style=\"width: 400px; alt=\" user=\"\" controls\"=\"\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. Please notify your app developers about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p><p><i>References</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library?tabs=javascript%2Cmanifest-teams-toolkit\" target=\"_blank\">Teams JavaScript client library SDK - Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/apps-in-teams-meetings/teams-live-share-overview?tabs=javascript\" target=\"_blank\">Live Share overview - Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",
