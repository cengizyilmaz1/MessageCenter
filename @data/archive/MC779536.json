    "Content": "Updated June 21, 2024: Due to some unforeseen technical limitations, this feature has been delayed and we will communicate via a new Message center post when we are ready to proceed. <br><Br>We are announcing that the Public Preview of solution-aware cloud flow sharing limits for Power Platform Managed Environments will be available starting in June 2024. This feature gives users the ability to turn sharing on and off for solution-aware cloud flows at the managed environment level and provides a sharing rule that can be applied to entire environment groups.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Sharing limits give admins the ability to specify which user(s) or group(s) are allowed to share data, and which data is allowed to be shared.<br><br> Sharing limits can be set at the managed environment level, meaning these limits would apply to all solution-aware cloud flows within that environment. Sharing limits can also be applied to an entire environment group, allowing admins to easily manage sharing across multiple environments.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare? </b><br> For additional information, please refer to the following documentation:<ul><li><a href=\" https://aka.ms/ADO6946/1\">Limit sharing of solution cloud flows in Managed Environments.</a></li><li>Learn more about <a href=\" https://aka.ms/ADO6946/2\">Managed Environments.</a></li><li>Learn how to <a href=\" https://aka.ms/ADO6946/3\">Enable Managed Environments.</a></li><li>Learn how to <a href=\" https://aka.ms/ADO6946/4\">Streamline governance with environment groups.</a>",
