Teams meeting transcripts are only generated when meeting organizers choose to record the meeting.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect business conduct and regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy. \n</p><p></p>To view the meeting recordings in Communication Compliance, a global admin will need to consent to sharing their organizationâ€™s Team recording transcripts with Communication Compliance in the settings.\n<p></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>You can access the Communication Compliance solution in the <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/compliance\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</p><p>Learn more:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about Communication Compliance</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/communication-compliance-policies?view=o365-worldwide&amp;tabs=purview-portal#classifiers\" target=\"_blank\">Create and manage communication compliance policies | Microsoft Learn</a><br></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/communication-compliance-channels?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Detect channel signals with communication compliance | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/keep-microsoft-teams-meetings-compliant-with-communication/ba-p/3933446\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Teams meetings compliant with Communication Compliance</a></li></ul><p></p>",
