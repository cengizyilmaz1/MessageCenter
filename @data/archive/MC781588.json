Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon, Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management will roll out exfiltration of business sensitive data to free public domain emails.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393334\" target=\"_blank\">393334</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by late May 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out late June 2024 and expect to complete by early July 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>We are enhancing the existing email insight alerts to provide additional information when business sensitive data is potentially leaked from a work email account to a free public domain email, potentially leading to a data security incident. The new domain detection group \"Free public domains\" will list the common domains used for personal email accounts. Admins with appropriate permissions can choose to select these domains in their indicator variants.</p><p>You can also modify the \"Free public domains\" detection group. Administrators with the necessary permissions now have the flexibility to tailor the default domain list in the \"Free public domains\" by adding new domains or removing existing ones. Should there be a need to revert to the original domain list provided by Microsoft, the \"Reset\" function can be utilized. The maximum number of domains allowed per detection group remains capped at 200, and this includes the \"Free public domains\" group. Any changes made to this group will be taken into account when analyzing potential data exfiltration to personal email accounts.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Any email going to free public domains (including email sent to self) will be automatically highlighted in email insights.\n</p><p>Updated email insight:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kC8s?ver=e6ce\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>Free public domains:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kMNW?ver=3526\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>New column and filters for email activities:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kMNV?ver=8287\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.\n</p><p>You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.
