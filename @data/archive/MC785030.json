    "Content": "<p>Updated July 26, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In Microsoft Purview policies like Data Loss Prevention (DLP), auto labelling can scan for sensitive content in most textual files, but images are not supported for content scanning today on Mac endpoint devices. With this rollout, we are adding optical character recognition (OCR) support on Mac devices to detect sensitive content in images and apply policies to protect these images.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392840\" target=\"_blank\">392840</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early July 2024 and expect to complete by late July 2024 (mid-June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Log in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">Purview compliance portal</a> at compliance.microsoft.com and configure OCR in <i>Settings &gt; Optical Character Recognition</i>.\n</p><p>Users in any of these roles will be able configure the OCR settings:\n</p><ul><li>Compliance Data Administrator\n</li><li>Compliance Administrator\n</li><li>Information Protection\n</li><li>Information Protection Admins\n</li></ul><p>When a user attempts to perform an egress operation with an image file (such as copying to removable media), DLP will detect and block sensitive content from being copied.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1kRhs?ver=97b2\" alt=\"user notification\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Billing setup needs to be completed before you can use OCR.
