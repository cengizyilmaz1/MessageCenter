    "Content": "<p>Updated August 30, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon in Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams: We are introducing a new meeting response option called <i>Follow</i> that allows people invited to a meeting to let the organizer know they can't attend but would like to stay informed. <i>Follow</i> goes beyond the traditional <i>Accept, Tentative,</i> and <i>Decline</i> responses. <i>Follow</i> is for busy individuals with high meeting loads and conflicting meetings. <i>Follow</i> is the ideal meeting response option when you can't attend a meeting but still want to stay engaged and have access to post-meeting information in Teams. Meeting attendees can respond with <i>Follow</i> in the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook on the Web. Follow is not available on Outlook for Mac or Outlook Mobile at this time. Additional <i>Follow</i> features in Teams for meeting organizers are shown in the screenshots in this message.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=154557\" target=\"_blank\">154557</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p> </p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late May 2024 and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May).\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously early June) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-September).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Meeting attendees can respond with Follow to any meeting invitation as long as the meeting has more than two attendees and where the organizer has requested a response.\n</p><p><i>Follow</i> responses will:\n</p><ol><li>Inform organizers: <i>Follow</i> will let the meeting organizer know you can't attend but want to stay engaged and have access to post-meeting information.\n</li><li>Free up time: <i>Follow</i> will mark the meeting on your calendar as free so you can better prioritize your time. You will still retain access to the meeting and chat.\n</li><li>Stay informed: <i>Follow</i> will remind meeting organizers to record and take collaborative notes during the meeting. You will receive a notification that the recap is available after the meeting (this feature will be available shortly after the GA rollout).\n</li></ol><p>After rollout, invitation response options will be <i>Yes, No,</i> and <i>Follow.
