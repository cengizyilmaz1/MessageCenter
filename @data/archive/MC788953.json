    "Content": "<p>Updated July 5, 2024: We are evaluating the timeline for GCC customers at this time and will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Defender for office 365 Services now allows the execution of several response actions simultaneously through the Take action wizard in Threat Explorer/ Realtime detection.</p>\n\n<p>Many Security analyst teams use Threat explorer to execute bulk email remediation actions, and we’re enhancing this capability with an improved Take action feature. This feature facilitates a more streamlined and efficient remediation of threats.</p><p>With the new Take action wizard, you can perform multiple actions such as purging emails, inline submissions, triggering investigations, and Tenant level block actions together with a single wizard up to 100 messages.  Moreover, you can take Tenant level block URL/file actions directly from Threat explorer. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to perform bulk email remediation for more than 100, this new wizard will enable you to do that in an organized manner. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the actions are not available based on the current location of the message, but if there is a conflict, the new experience gives more options and power through toggle. SecOps can use toggle choices to turn them on/off as desired and take proper action.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=393937\" target=\"_blank\">393937</a></p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout began in mid-April 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.</p><p>General Availability (GCC): On-hold.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p> If you are part of the Security Operations team and use Microsoft defender for Office 365 email remediation features, the following are the enhancements for the email entity page and email summary panel:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Step 1: Log into the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://security.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Step 2: Navigate to Threat Explorer / Real time detection and select the desired emails.</li><li>Step 3: Click on Take action.
