This will enable them to accurately align it with their business's current state and tailor it to support their specific analytical needs.</p>\n\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=167345\" target=\"_blank\">167345</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early May 2024 and expect to complete by mid-May 2024.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>Analysts will now be able to create a clone of the attributes they have available to them in Viva Insights. A clone by default has all the same data as the original column, but the analyst can define rules to modify or combine specific values as needed. The analyst will not be able to make any modifications to the original admin-uploaded column.</p>\n\n<p>By creating a clone, an analyst can create new groupings that will enable them to analyze the data in new ways.</p>\n\n<p>Analysts will only be able to clone attributes that are available to them in their partitions. Clones are not transferrable to other partitions.</p>\n\n<p>Image of the attribute clone creation process:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3gD?ver=da7b\" style=\"width: 600px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n\n<p>Review and assess any impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p>",
