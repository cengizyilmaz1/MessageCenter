    "Content": "<p>Updated May 22, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams: As a part of this change, IT admins would see Teams Meeting Recording audit logs enriched with the consent data. The consent data would flow into audit logs irrespective of the Teams Meeting policy for attendance report. Today, the consent data is visible only in the attendance report. This change improves auditing of consent data for Teams Meetings.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>If your organization had enabled \"explicit consent for recording\", IT admins would be able to access user consent information in the Teams Meeting audit logs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> </p>This is a non-breaking change. However, if you have not enabled the Teams Meeting consent in your tenant, you can do so as described in: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/meeting-recording?tabs=meeting-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Teams meeting recording - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><p></p>",
