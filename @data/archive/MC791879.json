While in DND mode, users do not receive notifications of calls, meetings, or chats, except from priority contacts. This automatic presence transition is aimed to help users concentrate on their tasks without interruptions. Based on customer feedback, we are now introducing this new feature for increased flexibility while working to receive notifications and messages while in presenting mode.</p><p>The setting will be available by default. Users must toggle the DND setting off to enable this feature.</p><p>&nbsp;<b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
