Users who are on old versions of classic Teams app will receive in-app notifications to encourage them to update to the latest version of Teams. This is to ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance enhancements, security features, and service reliability.\n</p><p>This in-app notification will not apply to users on machine wide (non-persistent setup) Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) deployments. Admins will need to regularly update those users to remain supported on Teams.\n</p><p>Per MC298823 (November '21), a version that is too far out of date will become incompatible with the service until itâ€™s updated.   Also see MC783985 for Classic Teams Timelines regarding end of support and end of availability.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This will be enforced on June 19th, 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Classic Teams- Windows Versions less than 1.6.00.18681\n</p><ul><li>Beginning August 20th, 2024, the Teams desktop client may present a blocking page for users and request them to update to the latest version of Teams from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>.\n</li></ul><p>Classic Teams- Windows Versions less than 1.7.00.3653\n</p><ul><li>Beginning June 19th, 2024, the Teams desktop client may present a banner notifying users that they are on an unsupported version of Teams.\n</li></ul><p>Classic Teams - Mac Versions less than 1.6.00.35956\n</p><ul><li>Beginning August 20th, 2024, the Teams desktop client may present a blocking page for users and request them to update to the latest version of Teams from this page.\n</li></ul><p>Classic Teams - Mac Versions less than 1.7.00.3856\n</p><ul><li>Beginning June 19th, 2024, the Teams desktop client may present a banner notifying users that they are on an unsupported version of Teams.\n</li></ul><p>Note: as the service progresses old Teams version will be missing features and may have significant service degradation, though basic features will likely continue to function.\n</p><p>The risks of not updating to the most recent version are:\n</p><ul><li>Your Teams desktop client may miss important security and quality updates.\n</li><li>The reliability of your Teams desktop client may suffer without recent bug fixes.\n</li><li>Your Teams desktop client may not be compatible with the Modern Lifecycle Policy, resulting in unpredictable behavior and missing functionality.\n</li><li>Client versions with release dates that are more than 90 days older than the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">current version's release date</a> may be blocked because the above is incompatible with the service.\n</li></ul><p>Note: Teams desktop clients on GCC High, DoD and 21Vianet currently have an exception to this <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">servicing agreement</a> until further notice.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To avoid disruption to end-users, the admins with users on Teams versions older than the supported versions (any versions with release dates that are more than 90 days older than the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">current version's release date</a>) should update their users to the most recent version.
