If the entry is encountered during mail flow or time of click with a negative verdict (the system has not learned), then a date appears in the column. If the entry is not encountered or the system has learned, then <i>Not used</i> will appear in the column. For example: You create an allow entry on May 7, 2024, with the <i>45 days after last used</i> date setting. If the entry is used daily, the <i>Remove on</i> date will not be triggered and the entry will not be removed. However, if the entry is not used after May 15, 2024, the entry will be removed on June 29, 2024 (45 days after the entry's last use).\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lD6y?ver=5815\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>You can modify existing allow entries in the <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList\" target=\"_blank\">Tenant Allow/Block Lists</a> to include the <i>Remove on</i> value of <i>45 days after last used date</i>.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lD9l?ver=2fb4\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>If the <i>Last used date</i> displays <i>Not used</i> and the <i>Remove allow entry after</i> value is set to <i>45 days after last used date</i>, the system will remove the allow entry 45 calendar days from the <i>Creation</i> date. This removal process will begin in late July 2024 for allow entries that meet this criterion.\n</p><p>This rollout will not impact any of your current <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/tenantAllowBlockList\" target=\"_blank\">Tenant Allow/Block Lists </a>entries that do not have a <i>Remove allow entry after</i> value set to <i>45 days after last used date</i>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you update the <i>Remove allow entry after</i> value of your existing allow entries in the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/tenant-allow-block-list-about\" target=\"_blank\">Tenant Allow/Block Lists</a> to <i>45 days after last used date.</i>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",
