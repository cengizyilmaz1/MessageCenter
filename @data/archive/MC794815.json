    "Content": "<p>Updated August 15, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience..&nbsp;</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Defender XDR: We will enhance email remediation capabilities with new Sender's copy clean-up features in Threat Explorer, email entity, Summary Panel, and Advanced hunting. These new features will streamline the process of managing Sent items, particularly for admins who use <i>Soft delete</i> and <i>Move to inbox </i>actions.\n</p><p><i>Key Features</i>\n</p><ul><li>Integration with <i>Soft delete</i>: Sender's copy clean-up will be incorporated as part of the <i>Soft delete</i> action.\n</li><li>Wide support: This action will be supported across various Defender XDR platforms including Threat Explorer, Take Action wizard from the email entity, Summary Panel, Advanced hunting, and through Microsoft Graph API.\n</li><li>Undo capability: An undo action will be available, allowing you to reverse the clean-up by moving items back to the Sent folder.\n</li></ul><p>Note: Sender's copy clean-up will apply to intra-organization emails and outbound emails, ensuring that only the sender's copy is soft deleted for these emails and inbound messages are out of scope.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out end of May 2024 and expect to complete by early September 2024 (previously late July).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, admins did not have a way to remove harmful emails from a sender's Sent items.\n</p><p>After rollout: This step-by-step scenario explains the functionality of Sender's copy clean-up:\n</p><p>You as the admin have already investigated in Threat Explorer, email entity, or Advanced hunting and have selected entities to remediate.\n</p><p>1. Create remediation: After your entity selection, you choose an action and create the remediation. For the <i>Soft delete</i> action, these items will be visible in the <i>Take action</i> wizard:\n</p><ul><li>Checkbox for <i>Sender's copy</i>. Select this option to clean the messages from sender's Sent folder.\n</li><li>Email count: Displays the number of emails submitted. This count will reflect sender’s copy as well.\n</li><li>Sender’s entities in a separate tab.\n</li></ul><p>2. As the remediation begins, the approval ID to track the action is displayed (Note: This is the same as before the rollout.)\n</p><p>3. Track the remediation status: The Unified Action Center (<i>Actions &amp; submissions &gt; Action center &gt; History</i>) contains all the approved actions. You can open any manual remediation action entry in Action center to:\n</p><ul><li>View the email count: This count will be same as submitted email count.\n</li><li>Review the action logs: The email count and action logs will reflect the status of remediable, non-remediable, failed, and timed-out emails, including the sender's copy.\n</li><li>Export action logs: The export feature will include the new column <i>IsSendersCopy</i> to capture the sender entities and corresponding action status.\n</li></ul><p>4. Undo sent items. The undo capability ensures that you have greater control and flexibility when managing email remediation, providing a safety net for actions taken in error or needing revision. Select the checkbox for <i>Move to Inbox</i> to trigger undo for the recipient copy and previously deleted sender’s copy of a message.\n</p><p>From Advanced hunting: The <i>Delete sender's copy</i> option under Delete email &gt; Soft delete:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lmWn?ver=d0cc\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>From Threat Explorer: The <i>Delete sender's copy </i>option under Move to mailbox folder &gt; Soft delete:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lsiw?ver=bd28\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>From Threat Explorer: The <i>Undo sender's copy</i> option under Move to mailbox folder &gt; Inbox:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lsix?ver=e89f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
