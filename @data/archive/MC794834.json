    "Content": "Starting in early June, we will be rolling out a new feature that allows end users to sort, filter, and search their canvas app galleries with Copilot.<br><br>\n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>\nWhen working with a gallery, users will be able to quickly filter, sort, and search for the items in the gallery using natural language.  This is a net-new functionality, as the current gallery does not support filtering unless the maker manually implements the capability.  This feature is designed for galleries that use SharePoint as their sole data source. More data sources will be added to have this capability in the future.<br><br>\n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>\nFiltering with Copilot will be automatically available for canvas apps to premium users in qualifying geos beginning in June. If they choose, makers can turn this feature off for their apps, and admins can disable the feature at an environment level.<br><br>\nFor more information regarding this feature, including instructions on how to disable it, please see this documentation: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/7267\">Filter, sort, and search galleries with Copilot (preview)</a>",
