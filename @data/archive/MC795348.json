Beginning on May 23, 2024, this feature enables you to use Entra PIM to assign tenant admin roles for a certain time period.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The System Administrator role will no longer be automatically assigned in all environments for tenant admins. Tenant admins can still login to Power Platform admin center and view all tenant level privileged functions, but data inside Dataverse environments will not be viewable. To gain access to Dataverse environments, tenant admins can choose to receive the System Administrator role via a new UI option in Power Platform admin center or assign the role via API in PowerShell.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>Please refer to the following documentation for more information about <a href=\"https://aka.ms/7116Link1\">Managing admin roles with Microsoft Entra Privileged identity Management</a>.<br><br>Communicate as appropriate with your Dynamics 365 and Power Platform admin and users.",
