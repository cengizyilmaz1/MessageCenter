    "Content": "<p>Coming soon to Microsoft Stream: We've improved the <i>Interactivity </i>feature where users with edit access can add documents links and other links to Callouts at specific times in a video. The goal is to make creating and editing interactive videos easier and quicker for editors by suggesting resources to link based on their Microsoft 365 activity. If no suggestions are relevant, users can search (while in Microsoft Stream) for resources to make their videos interactive.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=Microsoft%20Stream&amp;searchterms=396731\" target=\"_blank\">396731</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by mid-June 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 and expect to complete by mid-July 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, users do not receive suggestions in the <i>Interactivity</i> feature for relevant documents resources to add to their videos. They must leave Stream to search for resources.\n</p><p>After the rollout, users will receive suggestions from the Interactivity feature. For example, a user who is making a video presentation can use the Interactivity feature to add a Callout that links to their PowerPoint deck, Word document, or other reading material.\n</p><p>Creating a Callout that links to suggested documents in the <i>Interactivity </i>feature in Stream:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lDrt?ver=d959\" style=\"width: 500px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>The default for this feature is on, and admins cannot turn it off at the tenant level.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",
