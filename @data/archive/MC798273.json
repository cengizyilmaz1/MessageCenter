This allows the flow run to not interfere with the user’s other work.<br><br>\n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>\nDesktop flows can be triggered to run in picture-in-picture mode through the Power Automate for desktop console. Select the target flow, open the <b>More actions</b> menu, and then select <b>Run in picture-in-picture.</b><br><br>Please note, in addition, the <b>Run in picture-in-picture</b> flow property can be enabled, making this flow always run in picture-in-picture mode when triggered locally.<br><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
