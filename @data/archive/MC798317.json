    "Content": "<p>In Microsoft Purview, we are improving how users can open locked records in Microsoft Office client applications (Microsoft: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint). Previously, when an end user opened a file that was a locked record, they could edit it and press the Save button, but SharePoint and OneDrive would reject the save and display an error. To avoid this confusion, locked records will now open as read-only and prevent end users from making changes. A message will explain to the end user why they cannot make changes to the file.</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=395791\" target=\"_blank\">395791</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out in late June and expect to complete by late July.\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out in late July and expect to complete it by late August.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This feature improves the end user experience when opening locked records in Office client applications. Now, an end user will see in advance that the file is designated as a locked record and cannot be modified, ensuring that the end user does not spend time editing a file that cannot be saved. This improvement brings parity to the behavior already in place for the online versions of Office applications (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint).</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lxcv?ver=11f2\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is necessary to prepare for this update.</p>",
