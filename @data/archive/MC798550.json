    "Content": "Starting June 30, 2024, a new <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO7381\">desktop flow property</a>, <i>Flow timeout</i>, will be available within the Power Automate for desktop console.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Flow timeout allows makers to set a maximum runtime for desktop flows. If this duration is exceeded, the flow will automatically time out and halt. This will ensure that flows do not run indefinitely, become unresponsive due to unforeseen conditions in the target application, or become stuck in potential infinite loops due to the flow logic.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>The property, <i>Flow timeout</i>, is off by default but can be activated through a toggle in the Power Automate for desktop console. Once enabled, makers can define the maximum duration for the flow, using a format utilizing hours, minutes, and seconds.<br><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.",
