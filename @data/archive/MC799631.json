    "Content": "<p>Updated August 9, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are introducing small changes to the calendar event's right-click context menu in new Outlook for Windows and web, making it easier for users to respond to meeting invitations from the Calendar surface. All RSVP options (Yes/No/Maybe) will now be on the first level of the menu instead of hidden under an RSVP menu option. Also, users will now also be able to choose between responding to all events in the series or just the current instance.&nbsp;<br></p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=394680\" target=\"_blank\">394680</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 and expect to complete by mid-June 2024.<br></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out early July 2024 and expect to complete by early August 2024 (previously mid-July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>All users will be affected. There is no user or tenant setting to control this change. These changes will also make the context menu more accessible.</p><p>Below is a demonstration of this change.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lXwI?ver=3eb2\" style=\"width: 934px;\"><br></p><p><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
