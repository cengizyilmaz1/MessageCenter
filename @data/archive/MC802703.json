    "Content": "<p>Updated July 23, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2022, we introduced the ability for users to request apps to be unblocked from the App Store for Microsoft Teams. We notified admins about this request in Teams Admin Center. This update enabled an easier form of admin-user communication, wherein admins are notified about the apps that their users require to be more productive on Teams. We are improving this experience by introducing notifications for end users when their admin enables an app. Users can immediately install these requested apps and start engaging with them on Teams.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=389151\" target=\"_blank\">389151</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late July 2024 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out mid-August 2024 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously late July).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Users will be notified when their admin approves their unblock app request to inform them that the app is available for them to install on Teams.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lxqR?ver=12f8\" style=\"width: 366px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
