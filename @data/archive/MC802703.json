This update enabled an easier form of admin-user communication, wherein admins are notified about the apps that their users require to be more productive on Teams. We are improving this experience by introducing notifications for end users when their admin enables an app. Users can immediately install these requested apps and start engaging with them on Teams.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=389151\" target=\"_blank\">389151</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early July 2024 and expect to complete by mid-July 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late July 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Users will be notified when their admin approves their unblock app request to inform them that the app is available for them to install on Teams.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lxqR?ver=12f8\" style=\"width: 366px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
