    "Content": "<p>Updated July 26, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Purview compliance portal: A new compliance boundary cmdlet <code>Invoke-ComplianceSecurityFilterAction</code> will be available as part of the Security &amp; Compliance PowerShell. This cmdlet allows user to check if a given mailbox or site has the compliance boundary property value set. If the property is not set or if the object is in arbitration, compliance admins&nbsp;can use this cmdlet to assign the property value for the mailbox or site for compliance boundary to take effect.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=397091\" target=\"_blank\">397091</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=398451\" target=\"_blank\">398451</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out early August 2024 (previously mid-July) and expect to complete by late August 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Admins had no single solution to check or set mailbox properties and arbitration status, requiring complex steps with Exchange PowerShell for different mailbox types.</p><p>After this rollout: This cmdlet will enhance your organization's ability to manage compliance boundaries. It will be especially beneficial in situations where a Microsoft OneDrive site needs to be brought back into compliance following a user's departure, or when an inactive mailbox is not correctly assigned. This cmdlet allows for the straightforward setting of the compliance boundary property, based on user input, to address these issues.</p><p>This new feature is off by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date. To prepare for this update, we recommend reviewing the Compliance boundary cmdlet documentation at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-compliancesecurityfilter?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">New-ComplianceSecurityFilter (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn</a>. Additionally, ensure that your compliance admins are informed about the upcoming changes and are ready to incorporate the cmdlet into your organizationâ€™s process such as departed employees to ensure compliance boundary stay in effect.</p><p><br></p>",
