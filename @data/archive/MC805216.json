Thank you for your patience</p><p>Note: If your organization does not support iOS, you can safely ignore this message.<br></p><p>Currently, when viewing a Microsoft Outlook email, users can access the available actions in the top-right corner of the screen. We are updating these actions to be in a bar at the bottom of the screen, and users will now have the ability to customize the order and placement of the actions.<br></p><p>Additionally, users will now be able to access these actions from their Inbox view by long-pressing a message.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=398983\" target=\"_blank\">398983</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out in early July 2024 and will finish rolling out by late September 2024 (previously late August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>The functionality of conversation actions will remain the same. With this update, we are specifically changing the position of the actions, adding the ability to customize, and making actions available in the Inbox view on long-press.</p><p>Because these actions will now be at the bottom of the screen when viewing a message, the tab bar to switch between mail, calendar, and so on will no longer be available when reading a message. To get to the tab bar, a user simply has to go back to the Inbox view.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1maDq?ver=f0c1\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically.
