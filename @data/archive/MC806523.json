Currently, when a user opens a shared folder in OneDrive, they are taken to a view of that folder within the sharer's OneDrive. In the new experience, opening a shared folder will take the user to the shared folder within the People view of their own OneDrive. This view, organized by people, shows and allows access to all the files and folders that have been shared with the user.<br></p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395378\" target=\"_blank\">395378</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late July 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024 (previously late August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>With this feature update, opening a shared folder will take the user to the shared folder within the People view of their own OneDrive, as follows.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oG4X?ver=0078\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oXIi?ver=af03\" style=\"width: 100%;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
