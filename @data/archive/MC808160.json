    "Content": "<p>Updated July 23, 2024: We understand and appreciate the feedback that customers have shared with us regarding the timeline provided for the migration from Office 365 connectors. We have decided to extend the retirement timeline through December 2025 to provide ample time to migrate to another solution such as Power Automate, an app within Microsoft Teams, or Microsoft Graph.  Please see below for more information about the extension:</p><p>All existing connectors within all clouds will continue to work until December 2025, however using connectors beyond December 31, 2024 will require additional action.</p><p>Connector owners will be required to update the respective URL to post by December 31st, 2024.  At least 90 days prior to the December 31, 2024 deadline, we will send further guidance about making this URL update. If the URL is not updated by December 31, 2024 the connector will stop working.  This is due to further service hardening updates being implemented for Office 365 connectors in alignment with Microsoftâ€™s Secure Future Initiative</p><p>Starting August 15th, 2024, all new creations should be created using the Workflows app in Microsoft Teams</p><p>We will be retiring the Microsoft Office 365 connectors feature in Microsoft Teams starting August 15, 2024, and ending October 1, 2024. For similar functionality, we recommend <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/browse-and-add-workflows-in-microsoft-teams-4998095c-8b72-4b0e-984c-f2ad39e6ba9a\" target=\"_blank\">using the Workflows app</a> in Microsoft Teams, where we will continue to invest our development resources. As we strive for continuous improvement, the shift toward Power Automate workflows represents our commitment to providing scalable, flexible, and secure solutions. Power Automate workflows not only offer enhanced capabilities but also ensure that your integrations are built on a platform that can grow with your business needs.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>We will gradually roll out this change in two phases:\n</p><ul><li><i>Effective August 15, 2024:</i> All new connector creation will be blocked in all clouds.\n</li><li><i>Effective October 1, 2024:</i> All existing connectors in all clouds will stop working.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>This change will happen automatically on the specified dates listed above.
