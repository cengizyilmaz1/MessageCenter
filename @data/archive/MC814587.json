    "Content": "<p>Updated July 26, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In Gallery view for Microsoft Teams meetings, a room video is optimized and larger in size to increase visibility of participants that are in a Teams Room. With this update, the room video tile will dynamically re-size based on people count to ensure adequate and equitable space is allocated in Gallery view. If there is only one participant in the room, the video tile will be the same size as another remote participant tile. If there is more than one participant in the room, the room video tile will remain optimized, at 4x the size of a remote participant. To determine the people count in rooms, Cloud IntelliFrame must be enabled or there must be a room camera that is capable of sending people count via Accessory Signaling Protocol (ASP).<br></p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=400706\" target=\"_blank\">400706</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out early September 2024 (previously mid-August) and expect to complete by mid-September 2024 (previously late August).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The updated Gallery view will provide remote participants a better experience with the room video participants. The below image exemplifies two room participants in a Teams meeting. Conf Room Ruby remains larger in size, as there are more than two participants in the room, while Conf Room Emerald has one participant in the room and is the same size as other remote participants.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mRwm?ver=9d01\" style=\"width: 600px;\"><br></p><p>\n</p><p>This update is enabled by default, and admins have the ability to turn this off via the EnableRoomPeopleCount XML setting for Microsoft Teams Room. Turning this off will not send people count information for room video tile re-sizing.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
