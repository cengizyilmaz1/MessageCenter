Users can scan the QR code with their Outlook Mobile app to sign in without entering their username and password. Outlook will use their identity from Microsoft Entra to securely log them into the mobile app, and users will remain signed in to their mobile app unless manually they sign out.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1njKb?ver=d3dd\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1neFA?ver=ca74\" style=\"width: 200px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This feature will be enabled by default. Admins can disable QR sign in in Microsoft admin center by setting the mailbox policy AccountTransferEnabled to false. This action will prevent the QR code sign in, but users who have already used the QR code will not be signed out from their Outlook mobile app.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/use-qr-code-download-outlook?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Use a QR code to sign-in to the Outlook mobile apps - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",
