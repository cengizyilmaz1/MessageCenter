Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Starting October 16, 2024, we're gradually enabling IPv6 for all customer Accepted Domains that use Exchange Online for inbound mail. Microsoft is modernizing Exchange Online so our customers can easily meet their local regulations as well as benefit from the enhanced security and performance offered by IPv6.<br></p><p>More information on IPv6 support for Microsoft 365 services can be found at: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/ipv6-support?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">IPv6 support in Microsoft 365 services</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 16, 2024 (previously October 1, 2024)</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After we enable IPv6 for your Accepted Domains, when someone tries to send an email to one of your users and queries the MX record for the domain, they will receive both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (AAAA records) in response to their MX record query.    \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To take advantage of IPv6 connectivity, please make sure that you and your partner's update network allow-lists to allow Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints in the same way it allow-lists IPv4.\n</p><p>The Exchange Online IPv6 endpoints can be found here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges</a>.\n</p><p>To opt a domain out of inbound IPv6 so traffic flowing to the domain remains IPv4-only,  please use <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/disable-ipv6foraccepteddomain?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain -Domain for each domain you want to opt out of IPv6 (Disable-IPv6ForAcceptedDomain (ExchangePowerShell) | Microsoft Learn)</a>.\n</p><p>IPv6 enablement may impact the source IP type used by Senders when connecting to Exchange Online, as the source and destination IP versions must match. For any IP Address-based Inbound connectors in Exchange Online that are referencing IPv4 addresses, you need to either:\n</p><ul><li>Keep the sending server as IPv4.\n<ul><li>Coordinate with the Sender so the Sender keeps connecting to your domain(s) via IPv4 or Opt your domain(s) out of IPv6\n</li></ul></li><li>Change the IP based connector to certificate domain based connector.\n<ul><li>This applies to both OnPremises type (From: <i>Your organization's email server</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>) and Partner Type connectors (From: <i>Partner organization</i>, To: <i>Office 365</i>).</li></ul></li></ul><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",
