You also get the benefit of reducing your security breach surface and maintaining a more simplified security and privacy domain. \n</p><p>Learn more about the product:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/backup/?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Backup (Preview) documentation</a>.</p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n<div>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.
