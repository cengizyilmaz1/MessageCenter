This meant that if users wanted to open the file in a desktop app, they would first have to save the file locally.\n</p><p>Now, when a user double-clicks on an attachment, the file will open in the desktop app specified as the default app to open that file type in the user's operating system, just like in Outlook Desktop and Windows Mail apps. Single-clicking on an attachment will continue to open a preview of the file within Outlook.</p><p>It's important to note that, for security reasons, users will see a confirmation dialog every time they open an attachment of a certain file type unless they choose to dismiss it permanently. To do so, they must uncheck the \"<i>Always ask before opening this type of file\"&nbsp;</i>checkbox&nbsp;for each file type (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, jpeg, etc.).</p><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1npUW?ver=bf75\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p>This feature is available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",
