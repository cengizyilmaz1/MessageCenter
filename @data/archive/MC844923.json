    "Content": "<p>Updated September 18, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Teams is introducing a feature that allows organizers and co-organizers of meetings, webinars, and town halls to enable attendees to upvote significant questions and declutter by archiving questions from the main Q&amp;A feed.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=398445\" target=\"_blank\">398445</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late September 2024 (previously early-September) and expect to complete by mid-October 2024 (previously late September).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Voting on questions: With voting enabled, attendees can prioritize questions by upvoting to move them to the top of the Q&amp;A feed. Organizers and co-organizers have the ability to organize questions by most upvoted or most recent. Voting is automatically activated in events using Q&amp;A. Organizers and co-organizers have the option to disable voting via the Q&amp;A settings.</p><p>Archiving Questions: Organizers and co-organizers have the option to archive questions from the main Q&amp;A feed. This feature is particularly useful for recurring meetings or events, where previous questions may no longer be relevant and need to be cleared from the main Q&amp;A feed.</p><p>They have the ability to archive questions individually or in bulk from the Q&amp;A feed. Once a question is archived, it gets moved to the archived Q&amp;A feed. Additionally, questions can be restored to the main Q&amp;A feed at any time.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>Notify the meeting organizers within your organization that voting and archiving features will be available for use in meetings, webinars, and town halls. The <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/q-a-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-f3c84c72-57c3-4b6d-aea5-67b11face787\" target=\"_blank\">Q&amp;A public documentation</a>&nbsp;will soon be updated to include details on voting and question archiving.</p>",
