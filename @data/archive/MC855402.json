    "Content": "Starting August 8, 2024, the Delete stub, unlicensed, and removed Microsoft Entra group users feature will be generally available. <br><br> \n<b>How does this affect me?</b><br>Previously, stub users, unlicensed, or removed Microsoft Entra group users couldn't be deleted from a Dataverse environment. These types of users remained in a Dataverse environment with a <i>disabled status</i> and were unable to log into the environment.<br><br> \nYou can now delete these users with the disabled status in your environment to comply with privacy laws, regulatory requirements, and to free up storage space.<br><br> \n<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>  \nWhen you import users from another system, these users are created as <i>stub users</i> with a disabled status in Dataverse. These stub users will stay in the environment with a disabled status, or they can now be deleted. For more information, review <a href=\"https://aka.ms/7955/delete-stub-users\" target=\"_blank\">Delete stub users from an environment</a>.<br><br> \nIf an active user loses their Power Platform license, or if a user is moved out of the environment's Microsoft Entra group, they are set to a disabled status. You can delete these disabled status users in your environment.
