When this setting is changed, administrative roles and the report reader role will be able to see identifiable user-level information<i> if they have access to user/group/site level information.</i> Changing the setting in <i>Org settings &gt; Reports</i> using the Graph API or Graph user interface is a logged event in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center Audit log.\n</p><p>The update admin report setting API requires Global admin permissions.
