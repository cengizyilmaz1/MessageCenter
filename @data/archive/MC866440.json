This option is intended for users looking to do further data analysis and manipulation outside of the Amplify Reporting and Analytics experience.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1o8Zu?ver=48b0\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>The second option, Export to PowerPoint, generates a ready-to-share PowerPoint file, saved to the user’s local machine. The slide content in the presentation are snapshots of each card as configured in the report at the time the user selected the Export functionality. UTC or Local time, channel breakdown and enables or disabled channels, as well as the selected time horizon are all respected per individual card as configured at the time of export.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1o1bm?ver=db9a\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>For admins: you might want to inform users and/or update existing internal user training materials and documentation.</p><p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/use-reporting-signals-in-microsoft-viva-amplify-to-understand-campaign-performance-776ac7ec-71ef-48af-a67f-a6875f15d4e6\" target=\"_blank\">Use reporting signals in Microsoft Viva Amplify to understand campaign performance</a></p>",
