This allows you to move all your process mining entities, such as dataflow connections and custom metrics, and Power BI reports between environments or workspaces. This feature is now generally available.<br><br><b>How does this affect me?</b><br>The feature enables ALM for customized process mining Power BI reports. It addresses a significant gap where users previously couldn't perform ALM on their customized reports when transferring from one workspace to another. This gap could have led to inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and wasted time for business process analysts who had to recreate reports manually.<br><br><b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>This message is for awareness and no action is required.<br><br>For more information on this feature, please visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/ADO8077\" target=\"_blank\">Application lifecycle management in Process Mining overview</a>.",
