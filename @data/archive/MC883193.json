The new questions from these templates will also be added to the Pulse question library as part of the <i>Change management</i> category. These new templates are: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft 365 Copilot Readiness: Prepare for a successful Microsoft 365 Copilot rollout by understanding your teamâ€™s readiness.\n</li><li>Microsoft 365 Copilot Adoption: Get useful insights into how your team is progressing in key areas of Microsoft Copilot adoption.\n</li></ul><p>Conversations in Pulse reports:\n</p><p>Pulse authors will be able to respond to open text responses from Pulse participants. The Pulse author will not know who they are having a conversation with because the responder's identifiable data will be removed from the conversation. The responder is notified that their identity is hidden from the survey author.\n</p><p>eDiscovery and Microsoft 365 Audit support for Viva Pulse: \n</p><p>Users with Microsoft Purview access and tenant administrators can use eDiscovery to search Viva Pulse content from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. Pulse requests and responses data are stored in Microsoft Forms and can be looked up with an eDiscovery search of Microsoft Forms data in Microsoft Purview. You can now also look up an audit log for all Pulse events in the Microsoft 365 Security compliance portal.\n</p><p>A Pulse author responds to an open text response:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1olrF?ver=d662\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically, and the features shared here are enabled by default by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.
