Noncompliance with this could be exploited by attackers, allowing them to impersonate a sender address by misleading the client into using the From header to determine the sender instead of the Sender header.</p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>October 15, 2024</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after October 15th, you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address’”.\n</p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",
