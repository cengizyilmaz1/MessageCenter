The <code>cloud.microsoft</code> domain was provisioned in early 2023 to provide a unified, trusted, and dedicated DNS domain space to host Microsoftâ€™s first-party authenticated SaaS products and experiences. With this rollout, selected Microsoft products and scenarios will transition to a similar <code>static.microsoft</code> domain, in parallel with the previous domains. As part of this transition, the design of the portal (fonts, colors, controls, and more) will be adjusted to align with Purview branding and domain change.</p><ul></ul>",
