    "Content": "<p>Updated October 1, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>You can now collaborate better by having Microsoft Mesh event attendees join on a PC as a guest user. Event organizers can invite guest users outside their organization, providing an opportunity for broader collaboration and networking in Mesh events. Guests can sign in to the Mesh app to join events, participate in discussions, and experience the same interactive features as internal users, all while maintaining secure access control. </p><p>Guest users' creation follows the existing process for tenant guest user creation (outside of Mesh). For this release, guest users will require a Mesh license, just like regular tenant attendees, to collaborate within Mesh. </p><p>Guest access for the Mesh app on Meta Quest and support for anonymous participants will be supported in a future update.</p><p>Relevant links for licensing:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/teams-add-on-licensing/licensing-enhance-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Acquiring Teams Premium license</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mesh/setup/content/it-admin-led-trials\" target=\"_blank\">Acquiring Mesh Trial license</a></li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=Microsoft%20Teams%2CGeneral%20Availability%2CDesktop%2CLaunched%2CIn%20development&amp;searchterms=413713\" target=\"_blank\">413713</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by mid-November 2024 (previously mid-October).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 (previously mid-October) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Prior to this release, only users within your tenant could collaborate in Mesh events. When this feature is released, you can experience broader collaboration in Mesh with guest users in your tenant.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>This feature rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required.</p><p>You may want to notify your users about this change.
