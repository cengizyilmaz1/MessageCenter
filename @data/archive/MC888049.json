If users click such an app, a consent screen appears. If the user agrees, the app will be installed and be available everywhere in Teams, including group chats, channels, and meetings:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1oEYe?ver=3c84\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Admins should ensure that their tenant's app permission policies are configured to allow users to add and use apps in group experiences. No additional admin configuration is needed for this feature\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",
