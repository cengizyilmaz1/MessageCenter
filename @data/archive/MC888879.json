    "Content": "<p>Updated November 20, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The availability of the delete API (removeallaccessforuser API) does not stop a malicious user from resending a Microsoft Teams message to the same victim. To help prevent that, a block user feature will allow the admin to block the malicious user from reaching out again. To make this possible, we will use a similar feature as the allow/block list in federation identity credentials to block the malicious user from the entire organization.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=411138\" target=\"_blank\">411138</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously early December) and expect to complete by late January 2025 (previously mid-December).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Admins can now set up a list of users that are blocked from collaborating with their organization. If a user is added to the block list, your organization will not be able to have 1:1 and group chats with these users. If chats already exist before a user is added to the block list, the blocked user will be removed from the chat.</p><p>This feature is turned off by default.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you wish to use this feature, navigate to external access organization settings to turn this feature on and add users to the block list.</p>",
