It will adhere to current standards by displaying data only when the number of new hires meets the minimum group size requirement.\n</li><li>Specific rounding rules are applied to time-based metrics to make trends more meaningful and significant. For durations under 1 hour, rounding is to the nearest 15 minutes. For durations over 1 hour, rounding is to the nearest 30 minutes.\n</li></ul><p>Change to metric reports only:\n</p><ul><li>Metric reports will be enhanced to provide a four-week average, aligning with default report time frames. As a result, peer benchmarks, <i>Last weekâ€™s snapshot, Inspiration library articles, </i>and <i>Recommended actions</i> will no longer be accessible in the metric reports.\n</li><li>The home page cards for metric reports will be updated to compare metrics to the previous week instead of peer organizations.\n</li></ul><p>Updated metric reports:\n</p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1p76u?ver=5008\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n<p>This change will be on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review and assess the impact on your organization.
