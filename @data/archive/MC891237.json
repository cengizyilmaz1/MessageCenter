For example, as a Pulse admin, I can copy a link for a template Iâ€™ve created and share it to all users in my company so they can also use or edit a template to create and send a Pulse.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2024 and expect to complete by early October 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, it is not possible for Pulse admins to copy and share a link to a Pulse template. Users must discover templates for themselves in the Pulse app. If they can find a template created by a Pulse admin, they can use the template.\n</p><p>After this rollout, Pulse admins can copy template links from the <i>Template management</i> section on the <i>Customize templates and questions</i> page or from the template and share it to all users. Users who open a shared template link will go to the customization page for that template.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1p78k?ver=e587\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>This feature is on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n<br></p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.\n</p><p>Review and assess the impact on your organization.
