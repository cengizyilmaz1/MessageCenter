Teams Android Devices (Teams Rooms on Android, Teams Phone, Teams Display, and Teams Panel devices) running Company Portal applications older than 5.0.6061.0 may sign out or be unstable starting July 1, 2025. We recommend ensuring your devices are on 5.0.6152.0 as soon as possible as that is the latest supported version to ensure stability.\n</p><p>Please review your existing Teams Android devices and ensure they are on the latest supported and available firmware and application versions. In Teams Admin Center &gt; Teams Devices you can export your current device inventory using the Excel icon for each device type, this export includes a column for Company Portal version.  If you find devices not on 5.0.6152.0, please update your Teams Android devices to the latest available firmware in Teams Admin Center, you can review manual and automatic update options as explained in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/remote-update\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a>.\n</p><p>Since this Company Portal update is critical to ensure your devices stability, Microsoft will begin accelerated automatic firmware and company portal app only updates to ensure latest release for devices not currently running the latest release.\n</p><p><b>When will these updates happen:</b>\n</p><p>These auto-updates will start rolling out mid-October 2024 and will continue until late December 2024. \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>This upgrade is required for all certified and supported Teams Android devices including Teams Rooms for Android, Teams phones, Teams panels and Teams displays. \n</p><p>The accelerated auto-updates include firmware, Teams app, and Company Portal app updates, as required to bring the device to Company Portal version 5.0.6152.0. This process may also include multiple updates if the devices are on older versions.\n</p><p>Because these updates will be rolled out at an accelerated pace, the configured update phase timelines (Validation, General, and Final) will not be adhered to. These updates will be scheduled outside of normal business hours at the local time of the device, to help minimize any impact to your organization. The configured maintenance window for the devices will not be adhered to as well.\n</p><p><i>How do I know what firmware update contains Company Portal 5.0.6152.0?</i></p><p>Please review these links which contain the details on the applications bundled into each firmware release:\n</p><ul><li>Teams phones: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/devices/teams-ip-phones#product-release-information-for-teams-phones\" target=\"_blank\">Devices for Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li>Teams Rooms on Android: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/rooms/android-app-firmware\" target=\"_blank\">Teams Rooms on Android app and firmware versions - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li>Teams displays: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/devices/teams-ip-phones#product-release-information-for-teams-displays\" target=\"_blank\">Devices for Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li>Teams panels: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/devices/teams-ip-phones#product-release-information-for-teams-panels\" target=\"_blank\">Devices for Teams - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p><i>What if I don't see a firmware with the Company Portal 5.0.6152.0 app included?</i> </p><p>Microsoft has released the Company Portal app as a direct update in Teams Admin Center for devices which do not have a recent firmware bundle.
