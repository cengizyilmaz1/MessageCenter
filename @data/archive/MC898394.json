This is to ensure that users have the latest updates, capabilities, performance enhancements, security features, and service compatibility.\n</p><p>On new Teams, users on OS versions that are not supported will receive in-app notifications to encourage them to update their device to a supported OS version.  A version that is too far out of date will become incompatible with the service and the Desktop client will be blocked until the OS is updated.\n</p><p>Windows OSes support dates and lifecycle policy are documented in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/\" target=\"_blank\">Product and Service lifecycle page</a>.
