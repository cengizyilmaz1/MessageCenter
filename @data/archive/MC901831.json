Special folders such as<i> Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items,</i> and others will still remain at the top of the folder list, even when the rest of the folders are arranged alphabetically.\n</p><p>This change is on by default.\n</p><p>To change folder order, go to the new Outlook ribbon, and select <i>View &gt; Layout &gt; Folder pane</i>.
