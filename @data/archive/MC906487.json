Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint will modify the InitiatingProcessFolderPath column across all relevant Advanced Hunting tables to include the initiating process file name. This message applies to Windows activity only.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will roll out to all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers on November 18, 2024 (previously November 4).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, the InitiatingProcessFolderPath column is inconsistent across action types. Some columns include the file name, and other columns do not include the file name.\n</p><p>After the rollout, all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint action types across all tables will report the full path including the file name of the initiating process in the InitiatingProcessFolderPath column.\n</p><p>Consider the following example to be the new normal, InitiatingProcessFolderPath == c:\\temp\\<b>file.exe</b></p><p>An example of a possible current implementation that will be retired with this change: InitiatingProcessFolderPath == c:\\temp\\\n</p><p>Custom detection rules and queries considering the InitiatingProcessFolderPath may be affected.\n</p><p>If you know your custom detection rules or Advanced Hunting queries include this column, please modify them to consider the new convention:</p><ul><li>To modify your custom detection rules, go to the Defender portal &gt;<i> Investigation &amp; response &gt; Hunting &gt; Custom detection rules</i>\n</li><li>To modify other Advanced Hunting queries, go to the Defender portal &gt; <i>Investigation &amp; response &gt; Hunting &gt; Advanced hunting</i>\n</li></ul><p>To learn more, go to the <i>Shema reference</i> button in the top right of the <i>Advanced hunting</i> page.\n</p><p> This change is on by default.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Before November 4, 2024, map your affected custom detection rules and KQL functions and prepare a fix. Where possible, we recommend updating your queries before the release.</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date.
