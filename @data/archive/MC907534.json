This means that PDFs with mixed content will have improved searchability and discoverability.\n</p><p>The process to configure the OCR feature for SharePoint will not change. Admins can go to Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; <i>Home &gt; Setup &gt; Automate content processes with Syntex &gt; Optical Character recognition.</i>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>The change will be on by default.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/syntex/ocr-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of optical character recognition in Microsoft Syntex - Microsoft Syntex | Microsoft Learn</a> (will be updated before rollout)</p>",
