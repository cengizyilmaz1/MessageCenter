    "Content": "<p>In September 2024, we added new built-in reporting buttons in new Microsoft Outlook for Mac desktops that allow users to report emails as phishing / junk / not junk.  Admins can control the appearance and behavior of these buttons from the <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/userSubmission\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\"><i>User reported settings page</i></a> in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (<a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400;\">security.microsoft.com)</a>. Admins can also customize where messages get reported to (reporting mailbox, Microsoft, or both) and what the user sees both before and after reporting messages from these buttons. Your current <i>User reported settings</i> page has not been changed by this rollout. This message applies to new Outlook for the Mac using version 16.89.24090815(16.89.908.0).\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=371393\" target=\"_blank\">371393</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): Available now.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Outlook for Mac users did not see reporting buttons.\n</p><p><i>After the rollout</i>\n</p><ul><li>OWA (Outlook on the web), new Outlook for Windows, and classic Outlook for Windows have had this functionality since August 2024 and there is no change to it</li><li>Other versions of Outlook such as Mobile (iPhone and android) will remain unaffected by this change. We are working on the adding the reporting buttons to other versions of Outlook.\n</li><li>If you have the reporting feature turned off in the Microsoft 365 Defender <i>User reported settings</i> page or are using a third-party add-in, the reporting buttons in Outlook for Mac will not be visible to users.\n</li><li>The Microsoft reporting add-in (the Microsoft report message add-in and the Microsoft phishing add-in) will be supported until further notice. Customers who currently use the add-in and the new reporting buttons will see two sets of reporting buttons in the ribbon. However, when we add the new reporting buttons to Outlook Mobile clients in the near future, the reporting add-in will no longer be needed and can be removed.\n</li><li>The selections you make on the <i>User reported settings</i> page will determine whether your users choose the add-in or built-in reporting option in Outlook. Either option will report to the same place (<i>Microsoft, custom mailbox</i>, or both) based on the <i>User reported settings</i> selected.\n</li><li>Unlike OWA and new Outlook for windows, the built-in reporting buttons in Outlook for Mac do not support reporting from shared and delegate mailboxes.\n</li></ul><p><i>New reporting buttons in Outlook for Mac</i>\n</p><p>From all folders except junk folder:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qhJF?ver=f219\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>From the junk folder:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qmXq?ver=f0fe\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization.
