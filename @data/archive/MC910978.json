After that date, no further updates, security fixes, or technical support will be available for these versions of Office. While the applications may continue to function, using unsupported software could lead to potential security risks and other issues. Because migrations can take time, we recommend starting to upgrade any remaining devices your organization has running Office 2016 or Office 2019 to a supported version as soon as possible.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To mitigate these risks and ensure your organization remains secure and compliant, we recommend upgrading devices running Office 2016 or Office 2019 to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 E3</a>, which includes Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise plus core device management, security, and compliance capabilities. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise provides the latest versions of desktop apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with regular updates and continuous support under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/faq/modern-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle </a>Policy and is eligible for the Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on.\n</p><p>For scenarios that require a fully disconnected solution, we recommend upgrading to <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/office-ltsc-2024-is-now-available/ba-p/4244953\" target=\"_blank\">Office LTSC 2024</a>.
