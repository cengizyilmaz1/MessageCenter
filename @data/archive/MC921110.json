The beta version of the Places mobile app will no longer be available via TestFlight effective immediately, and existing users will lose access when the build expires at the end of November 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If you’ve joined the Preview program, you’ll be able to continue evaluating all Places features until January 6th, 2025. After that date, core Places features will remain available to all users with a qualifying Microsoft 365 subscription. Enhanced features will require a Teams Premium license, and some features will require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. If you need more time to evaluate these features, you may consider acquiring trial licenses.\n</p>",
