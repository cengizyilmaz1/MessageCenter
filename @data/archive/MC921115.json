This community can bring employees together in a community of practice where employees can ask questions, seek support from both their peers and IT admins, share best practices, and learn more from articles and quick tips on how best to use Copilot.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late October 2024 and expect to complete by mid-November 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Every month, there will be new suggested content to highlight new end-user features in Copilot. This is crafted from the monthly Copilot emails that are sent to the licensed users for customers opted into Microsoft direct to end-user emails. This pre-curated content can be leveraged by community admins to better prepare, plan, train, and roll out Copilot features to end users. The suggested content can be found in the community set up checklist or under the ellipses (...) menu on the right side of the community header, under <i>Suggested content</i>.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qpgT?ver=e611\" style=\"width: 650px;\"><br></p><p>The suggested content will be supported as an Article post type with enhanced design and readability of content for Viva licenses.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1qpgW?ver=c9b0\" style=\"width: 658px;\"><br></p><p>To help the community grow, upskill, and share knowledge, community admins will soon have access to the new<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/introducing-answers-intelligent-importer/ba-p/4109110\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Answers Intelligent Importer</a>, which can be used to upload Q&amp;A documents and FAQs into the community.
