Specifically, these are the profiles created by navigating to <b>Devices</b> &gt; <b>Configuration</b> &gt; <b>Create</b> &gt; <b>New policy</b> &gt; <b>Windows 10 and later</b> &gt; <b>Templates</b> in the Microsoft Intune admin center. The same settings found in the Administrative Templates can be configured with the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/configuration/settings-catalog\" target=\"_blank\">settings catalog</a>.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After this change, you will not be able to create any new Administrative Templates from the Intune admin center. Existing Administrative templates can still be viewed, updated, or deleted.</p><p><b>Note:</b> While this change does not impact the creation of new Administrative Templates through 'deviceManagement/groupPolicyConfigurations' Microsoft Graph API you should switch to the new '<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/intune-deviceconfigv2-devicemanagementconfigurationpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta\" target=\"_blank\">deviceManagement/configurationPolicies</a>' API graph endpoint for policy creation as soon as possible.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>If you are using Administrative Templates, use the settings catalog for configuring new settings going forward. As part of the migration of Windows configuration profiles, the existing Administrative Templates will eventually be migrated automatically.
