This new feature introduces a 'Regenerate' button, which will enable Copilot to create a new variation of that flow without needing to edit the original prompt.<br><br> \n<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b><br>\nThis message is for awareness and no action is required. If you would like more information on this feature, please visit <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aka.ms/8402\">Regenerate a variation of a flow in Copilot</a>.",
