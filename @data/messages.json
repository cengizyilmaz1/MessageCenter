Very large tenants will take longer.  While the index is provisioning, search requests will only return shared and public content.  Once the new index is complete, private and shared content will be returned.  If no additional search requests for private content are sent within 100 days, the private index will be decommissioned.  If needed again, a subsequent search request for private content will rebuild the index.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If you have applications which run infrequently (e.g. every four months) and use Search with Application Permissions, plan for time to allow the on-demand index to rebuild. \n</p><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/search-concept-searchall?view=graph-rest-1.0\" target=\"_blank\">Search content with application permissions - Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p>",

After this date, the app will no longer receive support, and the app will become read only.\n</p><p>To ensure the best experience moving forward, we strongly recommend switching your users to the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffzhvgqwwlhb?ocid=pdpshare&amp;hl=en-us&amp;gl=US\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft OneNote for Windows</a> app as soon as possible. Our team is focusing on enhancing this app, providing a sleek and modern interface and improving security, and releasing new features like Loop components, voice dictation and transcription, ink improvements, a new meeting details experience, integration with the new Microsoft Outlook, and more to align with the evolving needs of our users.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Although OneNote for Windows 10 is supported until October 14, 2025, it is no longer receiving new feature updates, and it does not benefit from improvements to data syncing.\n</p><p>Starting in January 2025, users will start to see notifications in OneNote for Windows 10 about the end of support. These notifications will provide additional information and direct users to resources for a smooth transition.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>1. Migration guidance</i>:\n</p><p>We have developed a detailed <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote</a> that includes best practices of migrating and a sample migration script. This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

You can start saving your settings in late August 2024.\n</p><p>When the General Availability release timeline is known, we will update you.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Users could not generate SAS tokens in OneLake.\n</p><p>After this rollout: Admins will have support for short-lived user-delegated OneLake shared access signature (SAS) tokens in public preview. This functionality allows applications to request a user delegation key backed by a Microsoft Entra ID, which can then be used to build a OneLake SAS token. This token can be handed off to provide delegated access to another tool, node, or user, ensuring secure and controlled access.  OneLake SAS tokens are constructed and used similarly to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Storage SAS tokens</a>, with a few key differences: \n</p><ul><li>OneLake user delegation keys and SAS tokens cannot exceed a lifetime of one hour.  \n</li><li>OneLake SAS tokens are always user delegated and must be backed by an Entra ID.  \n</li><li>OneLake SAS can only grant access to data items in Fabric.\n</li></ul><p>The usage of OneLake SAS in a Fabric tenant is controlled by two tenant switches:\n</p><ol><li>A switch managed by tenant admins that controls the generation of OneLake SAS tokens\n</li><li>A switch automatically delegated to workspace admins that controls the acceptance of OneLake SAS tokens\n</li></ol><p>Both switches must be turned on to allow the use of OneLake SAS in a workspace.\n</p><p><i>Scenarios supported by SAS \n</i></p><p>Delegated access with SAS tokens allows applications without native support for Microsoft Entra to gain temporary access to specific folders or files in OneLake. SAS tokens are commonly used for data integration workloads by granting external engines temporary permissions to write data to a staging location.  Many ISVs also use SAS tokens to grant their users temporary scoped-down access to their data.   \n</p><p><i>New tenant settings</i>\n</p><p>1. <i>Use Short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens</i> (Preview):\n</p><ul><li>Default Status: ON\n</li><li>This setting allows the creation of short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens by turning on the user delegation key API for the entire tenant.   \n</li></ul><p>2. <i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i> (Preview): \n</p><ul><li>Default Status: OFF \n</li><li>This setting enables authentication using OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens. This setting is automatically delegated to workspace admins, allowing them to decide whether their workspace will accept OneLake SAS as a valid authentication method.  \n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>1. Review and decide on settings: \n</p><ul><li><i>Use short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens:</i> As this setting is turned ON by default, please review its implications and decide if it should remain enabled for your organization. \n</li><li><i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i>: This setting is OFF by default, and workspace admins will be able to enable this feature. Evaluate its potential benefits and determine if you would like to enable it automatically for all workspaces.  \n</li></ul><p>2. Action for tenant admins: \n</p><ul><li>In late September 2024, OneLake SAS will be available in public preview. If no actions are taken on the tenant setting, workspace admins will be able to turn ON OneLake SAS authentication for their workspace. Note that <i>Authenticate with OneLake user-delegated SAS tokens</i> is automatically delegated to workspace admins. If you prefer not to have these features available for your organization, please turn OFF the <i>Use short-lived user-delegated SAS tokens</i> setting in Fabric before late September 2024. This will disable OneLake SAS generation for your tenant, ensuring OneLake SAS cannot be used, regardless of the workspace admins setting.  \n</li><li>Workspace admins will be able to enable authentication with SAS tokens for their workspaces if no action is taken by tenant admins.  \n</li><li>We encourage you to assess these new settings and make any necessary changes to align with your organization's security and access control policies. \n</li></ul><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>This message covers a change in behavior in Microsoft Outlook for Android regarding App Protection Policy and App Configuration Policy. Before this rollout, Outlook for Android does not adhere to the documented behavior when the App Protection Policy (APP) Org Data Notifications is set to <code>Block</code>. Instead of blocking sensitive data from being exposed in an Outlook notification, Outlook for Android blocks all notifications.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late September (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by early October 2024 (previously mid-September).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After this rollout, Outlook for Android will match the documented behavior and align with the behavior of Outlook for iOS. Specifically, Outlook for Android will ignore the <code>Block </code>setting value for the <code>Org Data Notifications</code> key. We are letting customers know because they might be dependent on the existing behavior and need to change settings to match their organization's requirements.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Prior to September 16, review the <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/limiting-sensitive-data-in-notifications/ba-p/1009778\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook App Config Policy (microsoft.com)</a> documentation and your organization's settings ensure that the combination of settings you have chosen will result in your desired behavior after Outlook for Android matches the documentation. After this date, the <code>Block </code>setting for <code>Org Data Notifications</code> will no longer have an effect in Outlook for Android, and you should use <code>Block Org Data</code> if you want to customize the data shown in notifications.</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning.

This means that security, privacy, and compliance controls and commitments available for Microsoft 365 Copilot will extend to Microsoft Copilot prompts and responses.  \n</p><p><b>When will this happen?</b></p><p>The update to Microsoft Copilot to offer enterprise data protection is rolling out now—and is replacing the current Copilot in Windows experience.

Changes will be rolled out to managed PCs starting with the optional non-security preview release on September 24, 2024, and following with the monthly security update release on October 8 for all supported versions of Windows 11. These changes will be applied to Windows 10 PCs the month after.  \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization hasn’t enabled Copilot in Windows (in preview), your existing preferences will be respected.

If you want your users to have uninterrupted access to Microsoft Copilot after the update, use the configuration options to pin the Microsoft 365 app to the taskbar as the Copilot in Windows (preview) icon will be removed from the taskbar as part of the update. \n</p><p>Users signing into new PCs with work or school accounts can access Microsoft Copilot using the Microsoft 365 app, which comes pre-installed with all Windows PCs.

For users signed in with an Entra account, Microsoft Copilot will offer enterprise data protection (EDP) and redirect users to a new simplified, ad-free user interface designed for work and education.

For existing users who are logged in with their Entra account they will automatically be redirected as follows:</p><ul><li>Web: Users signed into Bing.com/chat and copilot.microsoft.com with an Entra account will be redirected to the simplified experience on Microsoft.com/copilot.</li><li>Windows: Users signed in to Windows with an Entra account will be redirected to the Microsoft 365 app and will be able to opt in to Microsoft Copilot.</li><li>Mobile: Users signed into Copilot mobile app with an Entra account will be redirected to the Microsoft 365 mobile app and will be able to opt in to Microsoft Copilot.</li></ul><p><b>Note: </b>Please see \"What you need to do to prepare\" for instructions on how to manage pinning Microsoft Copilot in your organization.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p> \n</p><p>Users who sign in with an Entra account to Microsoft Copilot will be redirected automatically—no action is required.</p><p>To ensure people across your organization have easy access to Microsoft Copilot and can benefit from the security and experience updates to Copilot, we recommend you enable in-app access today by pinning Microsoft Copilot. If you elect to pin Microsoft Copilot for your users, it will appear in the Microsoft 365 app starting mid-September, and it will be coming soon to Microsoft Teams and Outlook. The option to pin Copilot can be found under Settings on the <a href=\"https://admin.cloud.microsoft/?#/copilot/settings\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot page in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a>&nbsp;(Global Admin permissions required).</p><p><b>Note:</b> This setting is for users who don't have a license for Copilot for Microsoft 365; licensed users will have it pinned by default just as it is today.\n</p><p>Additionally, if your organization manages app distribution for mobile devices, you should push the Microsoft 365 mobile app to these users before mid-September. For self-managed devices, you should encourage users to download the Microsoft 365 mobile app before mid-September or they will be prompted to do so when this change happens.\n</p><p>If you wish to inform your users prior to the change, you can use the below message: \n</p><p>“Microsoft Copilot provides a powerful, web-grounded AI chat experience for work with enterprise data protection. Starting mid-September, you’ll be redirected from copilot.microsoft.com and bing.com/chat to microsoft.com/copilot to access a simplified, ad-free Microsoft Copilot experience. If you use the Copilot mobile app, you will be redirected to the Microsoft 365 mobile app. If you do not have the Microsoft 365 app installed, you should do so.\"</p><p>If you elect to pin Copilot, you can also include the following:\n</p><p>\"Microsoft Copilot will also be pinned inside the apps you use every day like the Microsoft 365 app, Outlook, and Teams to make it easier to use Copilot in your flow at work.”\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you do not make a pinning selection by mid-September, your users will be prompted to pin Microsoft Copilot themselves. While not recommended, you can disable the prompt for end users with the same setting.\n</p><p><b>Additional Information:</b>\n</p><p>If you would like to try the updated Microsoft Copilot with enterprise data protection prior to mid-September, a private preview is available (space limited).

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in three major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete early November 2024 (previously late August): This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.\n</li><li>Phase 3: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user.

This feature will proactively terminate active user or admin sessions, or require reauthentication, and enforce tenant policy changes in near real time instead of waiting for an access token to expire.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-September 2024 and expect to complete by late September 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>CAE is the feature that allows user or admin sessions to be revoked when certain critical events occur, or the location of the user or admin is not in the allowed IP address range. The access will be terminated almost instantly, instead of waiting for a token to expire.\n</p><p>OAuth 2.0 authentication (open authentication) traditionally relies on access token expiration to revoke a user's access to modern cloud services. Users or admins whose access rights have been terminated still have access to resources until the access token expires. For the Microsoft 365 admin center, this access can be as long as an hour, by default. With continuous access evaluation, a user's critical events and network location changes are continuously evaluated.\n</p><p>Enabling CAE offers several key benefits:\n</p><ul><li><i>Mitigate insider and data exfiltration threats: </i>An employee can export a valid access token and replay it to gain access to admin center from outside of your organization. With continuous access evaluation, you can enforce IP location policies and monitor user-critical events in near real time to mitigate the risk of external access and exfiltration of data.\n</li><li><i>Prevent unauthorized access:</i> When a user account password is compromised, the Microsoft Entra administrator can reset it or disable the account in near real time to prevent unauthorized access to admin center.\n</li><li><i>Remove user access in near real time: </i>Organizations have an obligation to instantly remove an admin or user's access because of security threats, termination of employment, policy violations, or legal requirements. With continuous access evaluation, the Microsoft Entra administrator can instantly disable admin or user accounts and revoke access to organization resources in near real time.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to notify your admins about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous access evaluation in Microsoft Entra - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>CAE will be supported in Microsoft 365 admin center. To take advantage of CAE’s IP location conditional access (CA) policy enforcement, you should set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement\" target=\"_blank\">Continuous access evaluation strict location enforcement in Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a></p>",

Thank you for your patience</p><p>Microsoft is releasing a new <i>Admin-Controlled Migration to New Outlook</i> policy that will allow IT admins to migrate users from classic Outlook for Windows to new Outlook for Windows.<br></p><p><u>User experience\n</u></p><p>Enabling this policy (see instructions below) switches users from classic Outlook to new Outlook in three steps. Each step runs on a new app session (app launch).&nbsp;</p><p>Step 1: Users see a teaching callout encouraging them to try the new Outlook in the first session after the migration policy is enabled.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nGu9?ver=d5b0\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></p><p> \n</p><p>Step 2: If users don’t switch to new Outlook in step 1, they’ll see this Business bar message in the next session: “Your organization recommends using the new Outlook for Windows. If you skip this now, you’ll be taken to the new experience the next time you start Outlook.”<br><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nE0g?ver=a598\" style=\"width: 800px;\"></p><p>Step 3: Users see a blocking prompt encouraging them to switch to new Outlook.

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.

Some malicious actors have used free Teams trials to launch phishing or abuse attacks against Teams users. With this setting you can add another layer of protection for users against some of these attacks.\n</p><p>Between June 2024 and August 2024, we provided a 45-day window to allow you to review and update the setting before enforcement began. Now, by default, this new setting will block external access with trial-only tenants and requires explicit action from you to continue to federate with trial tenants.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Available now. Blocking or allowing external access with trial-only tenants with this setting was enabled August 15, 2024. If you missed MC805200, you can still manage the setting for your organization at any time. </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Teams PowerShell now supports the new Tenant Federation setting <code>-ExternalAccessWithTrialTenants</code> with the values <code>Allowed</code> or <code>Blocked</code>. When set to <code>Blocked</code>, all external access with users from Teams subscriptions that contain only trial licenses will be blocked. This means users from these trial-only tenants will not be able to search or reach your users via chats, Teams calls, and meetings (using the users' authenticated identity) and your users will not be able to reach users in these trial-only tenants. If this setting is set to <code>Blocked</code>, users from the trial-only tenant will also be removed from any existing chats. The default setting will be to block external access with trial-only tenants.\n</p><p><i>Important Notes</i></p><ul><li>A \"trial-only\" tenant is defined as a tenant with a Teams service plan that has only Trial subscriptions (0 purchased licenses).\n</li><li>Shared Channels, Guest access and Anonymous Meeting joins will not be affected by this setting.\n</li><li>This new setting only controls external communication with trial-only tenants within the same Microsoft 365 cloud environment.

Such publishing scenarios often result in very large audiences, which in turn may cause the denominator in the percentage of Unique Viewers calculation to be confusing to users, even though correct.</p><p>In cases where an audience is not explicitly defined and is simply “open to all”, the new Amplify reports will show the count rather than the percentage to provide the user a more comprehensible data point at first glance.&nbsp;</p><p>Example: The total audience is calculated by summing up the members of the groups with rights to see the published item. The user count is obtained by adding the Microsoft Entra ID users with permissions to the published item. This can result in a very large audience which in turn may cause the percentage of unique viewers to appear a very small tenth or hundredth of a percentage point. If 2.4K or 7.3K people of the impacted organization have viewed the publication, a campaign owner or author might naturally expect to see a report indicating they have reached ~30% of their audience. But because the publication was shared beyond the impacted business group, as a general interest story to the company’s intranet, the actual potential audience (everyone with permission to see the publication) is now 521,000 employees worldwide, resulting in the report displaying 0.5% unique viewers.

With this change, the index quota per license entitlement is removed, as is add-on cost for additional quota. You now receive an entitlement of 50 million items for each tenant.\n</p><p>&nbsp;As a reminder: Each entity (or record) from the source data system that you add to Microsoft Graph can be considered an item which then shows up as a unique citation in Copilot's responses, as a unique search result in Microsoft Search, etc. Depending on the type of data source, 1 item is –\n</p><ul><li>1 document (word, excel, ppt, pdf, etc.) in file share\n</li><li>1 wiki page in Confluence\n</li><li>1 webpage in a website\n</li><li>1 ticket/issue in Jira\n</li></ul><p>Total quota utilized is calculated in terms of total items stored in the index. Updates/changes to an item are not counted in any manner. There are no cost implications of updating an item multiple times.

Thank you for your patience..&nbsp;</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Defender XDR: We will enhance email remediation capabilities with new Sender's copy clean-up features in Threat Explorer, email entity, Summary Panel, and Advanced hunting. These new features will streamline the process of managing Sent items, particularly for admins who use <i>Soft delete</i> and <i>Move to inbox </i>actions.\n</p><p><i>Key Features</i>\n</p><ul><li>Integration with <i>Soft delete</i>: Sender's copy clean-up will be incorporated as part of the <i>Soft delete</i> action.\n</li><li>Wide support: This action will be supported across various Defender XDR platforms including Threat Explorer, Take Action wizard from the email entity, Summary Panel, Advanced hunting, and through Microsoft Graph API.\n</li><li>Undo capability: An undo action will be available, allowing you to reverse the clean-up by moving items back to the Sent folder.\n</li></ul><p>Note: Sender's copy clean-up will apply to intra-organization emails and outbound emails, ensuring that only the sender's copy is soft deleted for these emails and inbound messages are out of scope.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out end of May 2024 and expect to complete by early September 2024 (previously late July).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, admins did not have a way to remove harmful emails from a sender's Sent items.\n</p><p>After rollout: This step-by-step scenario explains the functionality of Sender's copy clean-up:\n</p><p>You as the admin have already investigated in Threat Explorer, email entity, or Advanced hunting and have selected entities to remediate.\n</p><p>1. Create remediation: After your entity selection, you choose an action and create the remediation. For the <i>Soft delete</i> action, these items will be visible in the <i>Take action</i> wizard:\n</p><ul><li>Checkbox for <i>Sender's copy</i>. Select this option to clean the messages from sender's Sent folder.\n</li><li>Email count: Displays the number of emails submitted.

As the remediation begins, the approval ID to track the action is displayed (Note: This is the same as before the rollout.)\n</p><p>3. Track the remediation status: The Unified Action Center (<i>Actions &amp; submissions &gt; Action center &gt; History</i>) contains all the approved actions. You can open any manual remediation action entry in Action center to:\n</p><ul><li>View the email count: This count will be same as submitted email count.\n</li><li>Review the action logs: The email count and action logs will reflect the status of remediable, non-remediable, failed, and timed-out emails, including the sender's copy.\n</li><li>Export action logs: The export feature will include the new column <i>IsSendersCopy</i> to capture the sender entities and corresponding action status.\n</li></ul><p>4. Undo sent items. The undo capability ensures that you have greater control and flexibility when managing email remediation, providing a safety net for actions taken in error or needing revision.

Previously, document library owners could set count-based version limits at the library level. With this rollout, we are introducing new automatic version limits that consider important factors such as age and restore probability to offer more intelligent version deleting&nbsp;options. We’re also adding manual settings for version expiration and count limits.\n</p><p>Here is a summary of the new capabilities introduced with this rollout:\n</p><ul><li><i>New Version history limit</i> options to meet your organization’s recovery objectives and version storage targets. Set version limits to:\n<ul><li><i>Automatically optimize</i> version recovery and storage without estimating limits; or\n</li><li><i>Manually limit</i> versions by count or version age.\n</li></ul></li><li><i>Set default organization Version history limits</i> on new document libraries and Microsoft OneDrive accounts for consistent version storage setting on all new libraries and OneDrive accounts created through the organization.\n</li><li><i>Set Site or Library level Version history limits</i> to meet specific content needs by breaking inheritance from organization defaults.\n</li><li><i>Report on version storage use of a site or library</i> by generating a CSV report to analyze current usage trends or impact analysis.\n</li><li><i>Delete versions from a site or library</i> to reduce existing version storage footprint or align with new limits.\n</li></ul><p>After this rollout completes, you can expect these changes:\n</p><p>1. New <i>Version history limits</i> settings in SharePoint admin center: Admins can set global defaults for all new libraries created in the organization. By default, the organization-level <i>Version history</i> limit will be set to M<i>anually</i> delete versions. Within the Manual limits, the default <i>Number of major versions</i> is set to 500 and the <i>Time</i> period is set to <i>Never expire.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h5nt?ver=1a35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2. New <i>Version time limit</i> setting for Document libraries: In addition to existing <i>Version count limits</i>, users can set <i>Version time limits</i> to delete versions based on age. <i>Version time limits</i> will be on the library's <i>Version settings</i> page. No change will be made to existing version limits applied to the library.\n</p><p>3.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out late October 2024 (previously early November) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RK?ver=e328\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l1kz?ver=7fc6\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lbkd?ver=777d\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RN?ver=d64f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies.

      "Content": "<p>OneDrive is making changes to storage policies of unlicensed Microsoft OneDrive accounts for business and enterprise customers. These changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants.*\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b> \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b>\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 90 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nwuw?ver=dea1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out in mid-December 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late December 2024 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l8xK?ver=d8ce\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l5Gc?ver=80b1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

As part of that change, Viva Engage will return to a simplified topics model, called Engage topics, and the integration with Viva Topics will be retired. \n</p><p>The following premium Viva Topics experiences and lightweight topics management experiences will no longer be available in Viva Engage, including: \n</p><ul><li>Viewing Viva Topics card when hovering on a topic \n</li><li>Viewing or using AI-discovered Viva Topics \n</li><li>Links to Viva Topics pages \n</li><li>Topic management via Viva Topics or lightweight topics management \n</li><li>Featuring of topics in Answers \n</li></ul><p>Using Engage topics, users will continue to be able to create topics, add topics to posts, follow topics, edit topics they created, and increase the relevance of their feeds by following topics.

General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q4 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted.

      "Content": "<p>Updated June 13, 2024: We have updated the timing of this change below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through January 1, 2025. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

Here is a list of features offered in Delve and the experiences we recommend using instead:\n</p><ul><li>Delve Home – discover relevant documents recommended on Office.com, in Office apps and  in Profile Cards.\n</li><li>Delve Profile – view profile data in the Profile Cards cross M365, through people in search on Office.com and search in SharePoint.\n</li><li>Edit profile – a new edit profile experience tightly coupled with Profile Cards are being developed and will be released in second half of 2024. It is also possible for users to edit their profile data in the SharePoint profile edit experience (editprofile.aspx). \n</li><li>Organizational view – exists in the Profile Card and as a dedicated experience in Org Explorer\n</li><li>Favorites – favorites on Office.com and OneDrive is not connected to Delve and is a good option for users with similar functionality and improved availability. \n</li><li>Boards – will not be replaced.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>December 16, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>You are receiving this message because Delve web is available to most customers in Microsoft 365.

Please note that documents themselves will NOT be removed. It is only the association with one or multiple boards that will be removed.\n</p><p>The new edit profile experience will for now read and write to the same source as Delve does, thus there are no changes in how admins can modify user profile properties.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend updating internal documentation and training related to Delve with the suggested alternatives.

Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.

If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks).

To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a>\n</p><p>You can also skip tool complexities and finish migration quickly with our 1-day migration guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-1-day-migration\" target=\"_blank\">1-day Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint)</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",
