Please review the message and thank you for your feedback.</p><p>We are beginning the process to standardize all transcript storage to OneDrive, starting with the storage of transcripts for meetings that only have transcription enabled. Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by early July 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, and DoD): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by early September 2024 (previously mid-August). \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled. This retention policy won’t affect the copies saved in Exchange Online, to bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p><p>We will also update the default transcript permissions. After the rollout, when the new policy is not applied, only meeting organizers and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, and meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams or Microsoft Stream. Regardless of whether the new policy is applied, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream the participants who are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>  \n</p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.

This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through January 1, 2025. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment. IT, network, or security admins inside your organization may be able to help identify instances and plan changes. Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">We are excited to announce that Phase 2 of app centric management roll out is scheduled to complete in late June 2024 (previously May). This phase will be available to all tenants and can be initiated at the admin’s discretion.</p><p style=\"\"><i>What is in phase 2?</i></p><ul><li>Migration wizard: a step-by-step guide to help you migrate the permission policies. You will be able to select which polities to migrate and designate users groups or individuals who should have access to the apps.</li><li>Testing and Validation: before finalizing the migration, you will have the opportunity to test and export your staged changes. You can use this to make side-by-side comparison with your current setup, ensuring everything is perfect before you proceed.</li><li>Duration: The migration process is designed to have no downtime for the end users and can take a few hours to complete. During the migration, your existing permission policies will remain in effect until the transition to app centric management completes.</li></ul><p style=\"\">Detailed documentation for the migration process will be available in our online documentation, which currently includes information on managing apps after ACM migration.</p><p style=\"\">App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can install Teams apps. First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=151829\" target=\"_blank\">151829</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>This feature will gradually roll out across three major phases. \n</p><p><i>Phase 1</i> (from late November 2023 to mid-March 2024 (previously late February) affects the tenants that use&nbsp;<u>only the Global app permission policy</u> and have no custom app permission policies. The app status from the permission policy and tenant settings will be migrated to preserve the admin intent. The migration will not affect the end users and their ability to use the apps. Admins may see the Manage apps page in a read-only mode for a short time.\n</p><p><i>Phase 2</i><b> </b>(late June 2024 (previously May)) affects the tenants that use both global and custom app permission policies. This phase will let the admin choose to migrate to app centric management by following a migration process that will change the existing app permission policies to app assignments in the new app centric model. The admins will have the choice to modify the apps that are assigned using the custom permission policies to be accessible to groups, if they want.\n</p><p><i>Phase 3</i> (more details coming soon as a follow up MC post) applies to the tenants that skipped the migration in phase 1 or 2. These tenants will be migrated automatically in this phase.</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>Starting with this release, you can:\n</p><p>1.\tManage Teams apps for selected set of users, groups or all users in the organization. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eEle?ver=d0d1\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1ezbo?ver=7bcc\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>2.\tSet the default value for new apps published to Teams app store for each of the app types: Microsoft, third-party and custom apps. \n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eBMn?ver=12ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p>\n\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p>\n<p>No action needed for phase 1 tenants with Global permission policy only.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user. If someone else were to sign in on your device, these local data on the device wouldn't be available to them.<br></p><p>A secure local web server on user’s device will handle the operations that users perform on their files in OneDrive for web, such as viewing, sorting, renaming, moving, and copying where traditionally these operations would need to be handled by the OneDrive cloud service. This allows to eliminate network as the bottleneck when loading and working with OneDrive for web resulting in fast and smooth interactions with users’ files like loading your files and folders, sorting, renaming, moving, renaming, and more.

Create remediation: After your entity selection, you choose an action and create the remediation. For the <i>Soft delete</i> action, these items will be visible in the <i>Take action</i> wizard:\n</p><ul><li>Checkbox for <i>Sender's copy</i>.

You can open any manual remediation action entry in Action center to:\n</p><ul><li>View the email count: This count will be same as submitted email count.\n</li><li>Review the action logs: The email count and action logs will reflect the status of remediable, non-remediable, failed, and timed-out emails, including the sender's copy.\n</li><li>Export action logs: The export feature will include the new column <i>IsSendersCopy</i> to capture the sender entities and corresponding action status.\n</li></ul><p>4.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We would like to inform you of an upcoming change that affects how a subset of users post and reply to conversations via email. The ability to create a new post or reply to an existing post directly using email will be retired from Viva Engage. Interactive emails in Outlook provide the richest way to stay engaged in Viva Engage conversations, polls, questions, and praise, without leaving the Outlook inbox.<br></p><p>Historically, users could create new posts in a Viva Engage community by sending an email to a specific email address for that community. Additionally, users can reply to an existing post via an email sent to that conversation. These flows will stop working. Users must instead utilize one of the options listed below for their scenario. &nbsp;</p><p>If users attempt to post in a community or reply to an existing community post via email after the feature is disabled, they will receive an email notification explaining that the feature is no longer available. All other email related Engage features will remain unaffected. Community posts will still generate email notifications, and users will still be able to reply and react to posts using the Viva Engage Web, Mobile, Teams, and Outlook interactive email experiences. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>Retirement will begin in mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and is expected to complete by late June 2024 (previously mid-June). We will not be providing extensions for continued use of these retired features. </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization makes heavy use of post to Viva Engage by sending an email message, they will be impacted by this change and may need to alter business processes. However, we expect minimal impact from this change for most customers.</p><p>After the feature is retired, users can expect to receive a bounce back email with deprecation information if they attempt to create a post by sending an email to the community email address. Additionally, they will receive a similar bounce back email if they attempt to reply to an existing post via email. </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Whether admin action is required depends upon how the post by email feature is being used in an organization. Most customers will have no action beyond reviewing internal help of guidance that may have been created for end users.</p><p>Admins can use the following examples to identify usage and key stakeholders within their organization, but other scenarios may exist:   </p><ul><li>If you are using an email client such as Outlook as a free form editing experience to create rich media posts, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/MessageCenter?id=MC712149\" target=\"_blank\">Articles</a> feature is the best alternative.  &nbsp;</li><li>When Delayed Delivery in Outlook is used to schedule when posts are sent to a community, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/save-and-schedule-drafts-to-post-later-in-viva-engage-dc806ad9-73bb-49ae-9c68-d800fd902649\" target=\"_blank\">Scheduled Posts</a>  is the best alternative, as it allows scheduling announcements and posts when the audiences are most active. &nbsp;</li><li>Automatic posting workflows may be set up to post new messages, or reply to posts, through email from outside applications. These need to be reviewed and changed to use alternative mechanisms. Posting is possible through the Viva Engage <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/yammer/messages-json-post\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/yammer/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Platform</a>, but admins will need to identify the appropriate solution and make changes for each scenario.</li></ul>",

The new gallery will be the default view when users join their meetings, so that they can use it without the need of taking an action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=118467\" target=\"_blank\">118467</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2024 (previously early January) and expect to complete by early February 2024 (previously mid-January).\n</p><p>Production and GCC: We will begin rolling out early July 2024 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2024 (previously late February).</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling mid-July 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously early March).\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously early March).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>This new version introduces a series of changes to help users in their meetings:</p><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio participant tiles for more predictability. A consistent aspect ratio maintains a more predictable experience when users turn their videos on or off. It also provides more visibility into users' body language and hand gestures.\n</li><li>An audio-video mixed gallery for a more inclusive representation. Audio and video users share now the same space by default.\n</li><li>Meeting rooms are displayed larger than individual participants. In certain meeting sizes, we display Microsoft Teams Rooms video in a larger size than the rest of the participants to give an equivalent weight to participants joining from a meeting room. Non-Teams rooms joining Teams meeting via Direct Guest Join will remain the same tile size as today.\n</li><li>You appear next to the rest of the participants. Your own tile will now be included next to the rest of the participants.\n</li><li>Customization of the gallery. Users can adapt the gallery to their needs or preferences. The customization options include:\n<ul><li>Gallery size: Users can choose the maximum number of tiles that will be represented per page. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Change gallery size\".\n</li><li>Placement of your own tile: For users who prefer to keep themselves separated from the rest of the participants. If chosen, the self-tile will be placed in an area separate from the rest of the participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"More options\" &gt; \"Remove me from gallery\".\n</li><li>Prioritizing videos: For users who want to give a higher weight to participants with their video on. If chosen, video participants will be displayed more prominently than audio participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Prioritize video\".\n</li><li>Meeting room tile size: Users can decide if they want to resize the meeting room tile to the same size as the rest of the participants. The entry point for this action is available in the contextual menu of the room tile.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eytq?ver=619f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1evPM?ver=9b49\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eDDx?ver=8083\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Please notify your users about this change and update any training documentation, as appropriate.<br></p>",

We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

Some organizations have set up Intune policies to prevent unmanaged apps from accessing data, which has led to users who are not able to save contacts in Outlook Mobile. With this rollout, these organizations can maintain their Intune policies and their users can create contacts in Outlook Mobile instead of the device's own contact editor (a third-party, unmanaged app form), greatly improving your ability to manage and enforce Intune policies related to the contact creation and editing experience.\n</p><p>This feature will not directly impact the Outlook Mobile Contact Sync/Save feature (syncing contacts from Outlook Mobile to the device's native editor). We expect a reduced dependency on the use of Contact Syncing to the native contact editor now that users can create, edit, and manage their contacts in Outlook Mobile.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1jPu6?ver=7062\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required.

Currently, when you make metadata changes such as title, description, transcripts, chapters, interactivity, thumbnails, media settings, etc. to files in Microsoft Stream, each of those changes cause new versions to be created. Each of these versions in Microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft SharePoint count the full file size towards consumed storage quota. Thus, for large video and audio files, these versions cause your storage consumption to quickly increase.<br></p><p>To prevent this, we are changing how Microsoft Stream handles versioning. Any changes made to metadata of files from Stream will stop making versions, thus preventing storage from increasing as rapidly as it has in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=395380\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">395380</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete by late August 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Changes to video and audio files from Stream will no longer take version snapshots.

To clean up existing versions of files or versions taken outside of Stream, the SharePoint team has a separate capability and new settings coming that will help clean up low value versions (see Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=145802\" target=\"_blank\">145802</a>).

Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in three major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 and expect to complete late August 2024: This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.\n</li><li>Phase 3: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization.

Here is a list of features offered in Delve and the experiences we recommend using instead:\n</p><ul><li>Delve Home – discover relevant documents recommended on Office.com, in Office apps and  in Profile Cards.\n</li><li>Delve Profile – view profile data in the Profile Cards cross M365, through people in search on Office.com and search in SharePoint.\n</li><li>Edit profile – a new edit profile experience tightly coupled with Profile Cards are being developed and will be released in second half of 2024. It is also possible for users to edit their profile data in the SharePoint profile edit experience (editprofile.aspx). \n</li><li>Organizational view – exists in the Profile Card and as a dedicated experience in Org Explorer\n</li><li>Favorites – favorites on Office.com and OneDrive is not connected to Delve and is a good option for users with similar functionality and improved availability. \n</li><li>Boards – will not be replaced.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>December 16, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>You are receiving this message because Delve web is available to most customers in Microsoft 365.

Please note that Delve and the new edit profile experience will work side by side until Delve is retired. \n</p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new boards, add documents to existing boards, view boards or search for boards when this change is implemented. Please note that documents themselves will NOT be removed. It is only the association with one or multiple boards that will be removed.\n</p><p>The new edit profile experience will for now read and write to the same source as Delve does, thus there are no changes in how admins can modify user profile properties.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend updating internal documentation and training related to Delve with the suggested alternatives. When the new edit profile experience is available this will also need to be shared broadly and documentation updated.

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events. If you have directed your organization to not schedule Live Events after September due to the deprecation announcement, you may now schedule Live Events past September 2024.

Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.\n</p><p>After rollout, app centric management will replace<i> Installed apps</i> in the Teams admin center and give admins the ability to install apps individually. The <i>Installed apps</i> in your app setup policies will be migrated to app centric management based on your current user and group assignments for each policy.

This phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with no <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. After rollout, these tenants will have app centric management enabled for their app installs. Admins may see the <i>Manage apps</i> page in read-only mode for a short time.\n</li><li>Phase 2 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post. This phase applies to tenants who meet both conditions: 1) tenants with apps added to <i>Installed apps</i> in the Global app setup policy and 2) tenants with no custom app setup policies created in the Teams admin center. This phase will migrate apps installed in the Global app setup policy to app centric management.\n</li><li>Phase 3 | More details coming soon as a follow up MC post.

We are adding a new admin control for admins to choose whether to involve a relay or media processor between meetings and 1:1 calls.\n</p><p>If Direct Media Connection is off, a relay or media processor will transfer the media between participants in meetings and calls. If Direct Media Connection is on, we will try not to include a relay or media processor between the participants in meetings and calls.

If the setting is False, the Teams client media library will not share the local IP address to the peers, which will force the media connection to be established through a relay server or a media processor server. If the Setting is True, the local IP address will be shared to the peers as a direct connection for better media quality and lower bandwidth usage.</p><p>\n</p><p>Note that as the feature rolls out the default setting for direct media connection as enabled (“on”). The default being \"On\" means all paths will be enabled and customers have the capability to force relay for meetings from admin-controlled config. Although it is not advised as it can impact meeting’s reliability and quality. Direct Media Connection is a user-level policy that admins can set as a tenant default or configure for specific individuals in their tenant.

No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RK?ver=e328\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l1kz?ver=7fc6\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lbkd?ver=777d\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RN?ver=d64f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies.

Pinned items will always be displayed first and shown to every user in the Connections experience, giving operators the ability to highlight the most important content. The remaining slots will dynamically populate with news content from the SharePoint News Source(s) selected by the operator and will continue to follow boosted news priority and audience targeting settings. This enhancement will be specifically for the desktop experience of Viva Connections, ensuring a seamless blend of prioritized content and dynamic news updates, providing users with a rich and engaging experience.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lclw?ver=d959\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=392098\" target=\"_blank\">392098</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by mid-May 2024.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCCHigh, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2024 and expect to complete by late May 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Upon completion of the rollout, a new Settings button will be introduced in the spotlight. Operators will see this button when they initially select the Edit button in the spotlight. This feature facilitates the customization of the spotlight component, allowing for the pinning of content, reordering of pinned items, and selection of SharePoint sites as news sources.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lclt?ver=08ed\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></p><p>For tenants that have not generated any content on their home site or in the Connections experience, Viva Connections will display out-of-the-box cards in the spotlight to help users orient themselves in Connections until the section is configured by the operator. These cards will vanish one by one as operators add content to the spotlight, either from the news source(s) selected by the operator or by pinning items directly onto the spotlight. Once two or more items are added to the spotlight section, the Discover more news in your feed card will remain as the last card in the spotlight section, similar to its function in the component today.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lclz?ver=6851\" style=\"width: 300px;\"></p>\n\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>If you have a home site paired with your Viva Connections instance and don’t currently have news, begin generating news on the Connections instance and add it as a content source for the spotlight. Additionally, you can select various content sources for the spotlight if you wish to diversify the news you receive.</p><p>Additional Resources:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/connections/edit-viva-home\" target=\"_blank\">Customize and edit the Viva Connections home experience | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul>",

Based on strong customer feedback, we will release enhanced version storage controls so you can meet your needs efficiently and at scale.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=145802\" target=\"_blank\">145802</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024. Admins can opt into the Public Preview by running the SharePoint Online Management PowerShell cmdlet <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-spotenant?view=sharepoint-ps\" target=\"_blank\"><code>Set-SPOTenant -EnableVersionExpirationSetting $true</code></a>. Please make sure that your SharePoint Online Management Shell is updated to version 16.0.24810.12000 or higher so you can run the specified cmdlets. For guidance, refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online\" target=\"_blank\">Get started with the SharePoint Online Management Shell</a>.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-October 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>What’s New?\n</p><p>We are introducing new version controls that help admins and content owners reduce storage footprint driven by low value file versions. Previously, document library owners could set count-based version limits at the library level. With this rollout, we are introducing new automatic version limits that consider important factors such as age and restore probability to offer more intelligent version deleting&nbsp;options. We’re also adding manual settings for version expiration and count limits.\n</p><p>Here is a summary of the new capabilities introduced with this rollout:\n</p><ul><li><i>New Version history limit</i> options to meet your organization’s recovery objectives and version storage targets. Set version limits to:\n<ul><li><i>Automatically optimize</i> version recovery and storage without estimating limits; or\n</li><li><i>Manually limit</i> versions by count or version age.\n</li></ul></li><li><i>Set default organization Version history limits</i> on new document libraries and Microsoft OneDrive accounts for consistent version storage setting on all new libraries and OneDrive accounts created through the organization.\n</li><li><i>Set Site or Library level Version history limits</i> to meet specific content needs by breaking inheritance from organization defaults.\n</li><li><i>Report on version storage use of a site or library</i> by generating a CSV report to analyze current usage trends or impact analysis.\n</li><li><i>Delete versions from a site or library</i> to reduce existing version storage footprint or align with new limits.\n</li></ul><p>After this rollout completes, you can expect these changes:\n</p><p>1. New <i>Version history limits</i> settings in SharePoint admin center: Admins can set global defaults for all new libraries created in the organization. By default, the organization-level <i>Version history</i> limit will be set to M<i>anually</i> delete versions. Within the Manual limits, the default <i>Number of major versions</i> is set to 500 and the <i>Time</i> period is set to <i>Never expire.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h5nt?ver=1a35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2. New <i>Version time limit</i> setting for Document libraries: In addition to existing <i>Version count limits</i>, users can set <i>Version time limits</i> to delete versions based on age. <i>Version time limits</i> will be on the library's <i>Version settings</i> page. No change will be made to existing version limits applied to the library.\n</p><p>3. New <i>Expiring in</i> column on a file's <i>Version history</i> view: Users will be able to:\n</p><ul><li>View an expiration applied to a file's versions based on the library settings\n</li><li>Set individual file versions to never expire\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review updated documentation:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/document-library-version-history-limits\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Overview of Version History Limits for Document Libraries and OneDrive</a></li><li>End user documentation: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-and-configure-versioning-for-a-list-or-library-1555d642-23ee-446a-990a-bcab618c7a37\" target=\"_blank\">Enable and configure versioning for a list or library</a>\n</li></ul><p>To send feedback or questions about this change, select <i>Like</i> or <i>Dislike</i> at the top of this message in the Microsoft 365 message center.</p>",

After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As previously communicated in MC679739 <i>Yammer Rebranding to Viva Engage Domain Migration Update</i> (October 2023), the web domain migration of Microsoft Viva Engage is a crucial step in providing a consistent experience. To ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential disruptions to your workflows, we find it necessary to adjust our original timeline.<br></p><p>The new release date for the web domain migration is now set to begin in late March. This decision has been made to safeguard your experience and minimize any potential negative impacts on your daily work. We apologize for any effect that this delay may have caused you.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=180352\" target=\"_blank\">180352</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out in mid-June 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by mid-July 2024 (previously early April). We can't give you an exact date for when the change will roll out to your tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the importance of your workflows. By delaying the release, we can thoroughly test and validate the changes to help guarantee a seamless transition. We ask you to continue following our previous recommendations to prepare for this change, as they remain applicable.</p><p>It's important to note that these release dates are only for the web domain migration. The email sender domain change has not yet been rescheduled. We will announce updates on the email sender domain changes in a future message center post.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your ongoing support and patience as we work diligently to ensure that this change does not disrupt your daily work.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>We will redirect URLs from the old domain (https://web.yammer.com) to the new domain (https://engage.cloud.microsoft/) to ensure uninterrupted access to Viva Engage and related features. These redirects will work with supported browsers and will be retained for the long term, so items like bookmarks should transition seamlessly. Users who are in Viva Engage at the same time as the change rolls out may need to refresh their browsers once to be redirected to the new domain.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Review all places where you may have explicitly configured or hardcoded domain names. Share this information on the domain changes with the relevant admins to give them time to make the necessary changes. Use any changes you have implemented for the old domain as a guide to what you may need to implement for the new domain.  \n</p><p>While these changes are not anticipated to affect our APIs, it is possible that the old domain is hardcoded in a custom application, script, or automation–possibly in an unsupported manner. Review your usage of custom applications and contact your developer or partner for updates.</p><p>Learn more about the rebranding: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/yammer-is-evolving-to-viva-engage/ba-p/3738825#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20all%20of%20Yammer%20will%20evolve%20to,will%20be%20updated%20to%20reflect%20Viva%20Engage%20branding\" target=\"_blank\">Yammer is evolving to Viva Engage - Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>",

URBAC is currently in opt-in mode.&nbsp;<br>The new Service Plan has no impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control (URBAC) provides an alternative to traditional Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO/EOP) and Exchange Online (EXO) RBAC.  By default, there are no changes to your security portal permissions.  If you want to enable Unified RBAC, then you must first configure the new URBAC roles for your organization. Once you have configured these roles, then you can enable use of URBAC for ‘Microsoft Defender for Office’ permissions and/or ‘Exchange Online’ permissions.  Doing so replaces your existing RBAC with the new roles.  You can find more information over here - <a href=\"https://aka.ms/M365DRBAC\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC) | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Unified RBAC provides an import roles wizard which will help migrate the permissions from your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 role groups.  It will create URBAC role groups with permissions that mirror the legacy permissions and groups you have already set up.  It will not migrate/replicate Exchange Online permissions – these will require manual configuration in URBAC role groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that URBAC will continue to respect existing Microsoft Entra global roles when you activate the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model for Defender for Office 365. i.e. Global Admins and Security Admins will retain assigned admin privileges.</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal.

There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are currently working to improve user experience by providing a coherent profile photo experience across Microsoft 365. This primarily impacts those users of SharePoint online (SPO) who neither have an exchange license nor are using Delve for uploading images. This may also impact a small number of SPO admin who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this change in early October 2023 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by late June 2024 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>Currently, for users who do not have an Exchange License and have uploaded multiple different images across different apps in Microsoft 365, it is likely that SPO displays images uploaded locally in SPO which will be different from User Profile images in other Microsoft 365 apps.\n</p><p>To ensure that the same image is available across all Microsoft 365 experiences, going forward, SPO will display images sourced via MS Graph endpoint from Microsoft People System (MPS). This implies that the image uploaded via other apps in Microsoft 365 will take precedence and get displayed in SPO instead of the locally available image in SharePoint. There is no action required from users at this point.\n</p><p>For users with Exchange licenses there is no functional change.</p><p>To ensure profile coherence, we will disable local uploads from SPO to mysite host and instead enable centralized uploads to Microsoft People System (MPS).<br></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>For all users identified above: The profile image will no longer be edited/uploaded through SPO “Edit Profile UI” experience or through “Person Immersive” UI experiences. Instead, all such users would be requested to use the “Universal Me” control available on top right corner of the SharePoint Home page for uploading images. Alternatively, they can also use Delve to upload profile images.\n</p><p>For SPO admins: Admins who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users will no longer be able to upload images via SPO Admin Centre. Instead, all SPO admins will be requested to upload user profile images via MAC Admin Centre or AAD admin center.\n</p><p>We are providing an early heads-up to ensure our customers have sufficient time to adapt to upcoming changes as we will not be able to grant any extension for this change.</p><p>\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://aka.ms/taskpublishinginplanner\" target=\"_blank\">task publishing experience</a>&nbsp;allows frontline organizations to distribute tasks across employees spread across geographically dispersed locations and then monitor how that work is going. Task publishing is available in Microsoft Teams as part of the <i>Tasks by Planner and To Do</i>&nbsp;app, which will soon be renamed to <i>Planner</i>.</p><p>We're releasing several new task publishing features based on top customer requests and feedback:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><b>Recurring task lists</b>. You'll be able to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the cadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish the list and task publishing will automatically send future tasks. We know this will be a time saver for distributing repeat tasks across frontline locations. Common applications are weekly/monthly site inspections and compliance walks or daily opening and closing tasks.\n</li><li><b>Training and policy task lists. </b>You'll be able to create a task list for each member of a recipient team. When you publish the list and choose the recipient teams, a copy of the tasks in the list will be created for and assigned to each member of the recipient teams. This is a great option for training tasks or tasks where employees must acknowledge a new policy.</li><li><b>Form completion requirement.</b>&nbsp;You'll be able to add a form completion requirement to a task, which allows you to create a Microsoft Forms survey that must be completed by a member of each recipient team before that team can complete the task.&nbsp;You can use any Forms question types, including a question that requires a file upload for employees to show their work. You'll be able to centrally review the form submissions across the locations.</li><li><b>Approval completion requirement.&nbsp;</b>Similarly, you'll be able to add an approval completion requirement to a task, which means that the task cannot be approved until an approval of the completed work is requested and granted. The approval can be requested directly from the task details by the user completing the task.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These features will be enabled as part of the rollout of the new Planner experience (more info at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/thenewplanner\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">https://aka.ms/thenewplanner</a>).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=135562\" target=\"_blank\">135562</a>.</p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 (previously mid-March) and expect to complete by mid-April 2024 (previously late March).<br></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>If you are using the task publishing feature, you will see new options when creating task lists and tasks.</p><ul><li>For recurrence options when working with a draft list, you can select <i>Does not recur </i>next to the list title to change the recurrence setting (Screenshot 1 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to create a task list for each team member when you click the <i>New list</i> button (Screenshot 2 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to add a form completion requirement or approval completion requirement to a task after you've created a task in the draft task list.

You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q3 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Microsoft 365 Apps are disabling server sign-in prompts using Basic authentication in Office Apps. We are making this change because basic authentication is a legacy authentication method that sends a username and password with each request. As a result, an attacker can access these credentials and use them to access resources. Continued use of Basic Authentication is a big security concern, so we have decided to deprecate it from all tenants.</p><p>\n</p><p>We will retire this feature in Office Apps version 2307+. Instead, we recommend moving to a more secure authentication method, preferably Modern Authentication, and enabling multi-factor authentication based on OAuth2.0 token-based auth.<br></p><p>This retirement will not affect Exchange Online and Exchange on-premises. Customers using basic authentication to connect to Exchange on-premises/Exchange Online can continue to use basic authentication without any changes to Exchange.<br></p><p>There is a separate effort to retire Outlook connecting to Exchange Online using Basic Authentication. Please see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/basic-authentication-deprecation-in-exchange-online-september/ba-p/3609437/page/2\" target=\"_blank\">Exchange Online - September 2022 Update</a>.\n</p><p>Windows files share access is not affected.

More information is here - <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-authentication\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft SMB Protocol Authentication - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn</a>.\n</p><p>Access to files stored on SharePoint on-premises server that are using basic authentication will be blocked. However, files stored on SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business are not affected. Customers who currently store files on web servers that use Basic authentication can move those files to SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Server on-premises as a solution.\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> This change is only impactful for organizations with on premises servers. If you do not have on premises servers, you can safely disregard this message.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>We will begin rolling this change to Current Channel in August 2023.</p><p>For additional channel timing please review: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/deployoffice/security/basic-authentication-prompts-blocked#versions-of-microsoft-365-apps-affected-by-this-change\" target=\"_blank\">Basic authentication sign-in prompts are blocked by default in Microsoft 365 Apps</a></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Once Basic authentication is disabled in your tenant, users with the Office Version 2307 or higher on their devices will not be able to access resources from servers using Basic authentication.<br></p><p>After the upgrade, end-users will get a Blocking message.

Here are the end of support dates for perpetual versions of Office that include the Office Telemetry Dashboard: \n</p><ul><li>Microsoft Office 2013 – April 11, 2023 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2016 – October 14, 2025 \n</li><li>Microsoft Office 2019 – October 14, 2025 \n</li></ul><p> <b>How this will affect your organization:</b> </p><p>Once a device in your organization updates to Version 2208 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps, Office Telemetry Dashboard components will be either removed or become unsupported.</p><p>To access information about the COM and VSTO add-ins in your environment, you can use the inventory feature available in the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center \n</p><p> <b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>As the devices update to Version 2208 or later, the Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Agent will be automatically uninstalled from the devices.</p><p>However, the Office Telemetry Processor will need to be manually removed from devices using your standard management tools as there will be no new data for it to process. Similarly, the rest of the infrastructure including the shared folder and the SQL Server for permanent storage of telemetry data will become obsolete and therefore can be removed.  \n</p>",
