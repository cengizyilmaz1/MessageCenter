      "Content": "<p>Updated May 1, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user.

Users can easily revert to an older version if business needs change or if files are damaged by user error or malware. Version storage controls allow you as admins to set an appropriate level of recoverability and auditability for your organization. Based on strong customer feedback, we will release enhanced version storage controls so you can meet your needs efficiently and at scale.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=145802\" target=\"_blank\">145802</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.

Previously, document library owners could set count-based version limits at the library level. With this rollout, we are introducing new automatic version limits that consider important factors such as age and restore probability to offer more intelligent version deleting&nbsp;options. We’re also adding manual settings for version expiration and count limits.\n</p><p>Here is a summary of the new capabilities introduced with this rollout:\n</p><ul><li><i>New Version history limit</i> options to meet your organization’s recovery objectives and version storage targets. Set version limits to:\n<ul><li><i>Automatically optimize</i> version recovery and storage without estimating limits; or\n</li><li><i>Manually limit</i> versions by count or version age.\n</li></ul></li><li><i>Set default organization Version history limits</i> on new document libraries and Microsoft OneDrive accounts for consistent version storage setting on all new libraries and OneDrive accounts created through the organization.\n</li><li><i>Set Site or Library level Version history limits</i> to meet specific content needs by breaking inheritance from organization defaults.\n</li><li><i>Report on version storage use of a site or library</i> by generating a CSV report to analyze current usage trends or impact analysis.\n</li><li><i>Delete versions from a site or library</i> to reduce existing version storage footprint or align with new limits.\n</li></ul><p>After this rollout completes, you can expect these changes:\n</p><p>1. New <i>Version history limits</i> settings in SharePoint admin center: Admins can set global defaults for all new libraries created in the organization. By default, the organization-level <i>Version history</i> limit will be set to M<i>anually</i> delete versions. Within the Manual limits, the default <i>Number of major versions</i> is set to 500 and the <i>Time</i> period is set to <i>Never expire.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h5nt?ver=1a35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2. New <i>Version time limit</i> setting for Document libraries: In addition to existing <i>Version count limits</i>, users can set <i>Version time limits</i> to delete versions based on age. <i>Version time limits</i> will be on the library's <i>Version settings</i> page. No change will be made to existing version limits applied to the library.\n</p><p>3. New <i>Expiring in</i> column on a file's <i>Version history</i> view: Users will be able to:\n</p><ul><li>View an expiration applied to a file's versions based on the library settings\n</li><li>Set individual file versions to never expire\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review updated documentation:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/document-library-version-history-limits\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Overview of Version History Limits for Document Libraries and OneDrive</a></li><li>End user documentation: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-and-configure-versioning-for-a-list-or-library-1555d642-23ee-446a-990a-bcab618c7a37\" target=\"_blank\">Enable and configure versioning for a list or library</a>\n</li></ul><p>To send feedback or questions about this change, select <i>Like</i> or <i>Dislike</i> at the top of this message in the Microsoft 365 message center.</p>",

Moreover, you can take Tenant level block URL/file actions directly from Threat explorer. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to perform bulk email remediation for more than 100, this new wizard will enable you to do that in an organized manner. </p>\n\n<p>Some of the actions are not available based on the current location of the message, but if there is a conflict, the new experience gives more options and power through toggle. SecOps can use toggle choices to turn them on/off as desired and take proper action.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=393937\" target=\"_blank\">393937</a></p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>General Availability (Worldwide): Rollout began in mid-April 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p> If you are part of the Security Operations team and use Microsoft defender for Office 365 email remediation features, the following are the enhancements for the email entity page and email summary panel:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Step 1: Log into the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at <a href=\"https://security.microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://security.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;</li><li>Step 2: Navigate to Threat Explorer / Real time detection and select the desired emails.</li><li>Step 3: Click on Take action.

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.

      "Content": "<p>Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

A user will be able to select the three-dot menu on files shared in Teams chat or channels, and then choose <i>Workflows</i>. From <i>Workflows</i>, the user will choose an instant workflow to run on a file. The user must set up the workflows in advance. A user can set up a new workflow for files by selecting <i>See more workflows </i>at the bottom of the three-dot menu. This launches the Workflows task module, where a user can choose a template to start setting up a new workflow. Examples of file workflows include Request approval for selected file, Get notified in Teams when a file is updated, Create a PDF copy of the file, and Add a task for this file.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1jVFL?ver=c127\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p>If the Power Automate app is disabled in the Teams admin center, users will not see this option in the three-dot menu.\n</p><p>This feature will only be available in the New Teams client on the desktop and on the web.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is needed from you to prepare for this rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We would like to inform you of an upcoming change that affects how a subset of users post and reply to conversations via email. The ability to create a new post or reply to an existing post directly using email will be retired from Viva Engage. Interactive emails in Outlook provide the richest way to stay engaged in Viva Engage conversations, polls, questions, and praise, without leaving the Outlook inbox.<br></p><p>Historically, users could create new posts in a Viva Engage community by sending an email to a specific email address for that community. Additionally, users can reply to an existing post via an email sent to that conversation. These flows will stop working. Users must instead utilize one of the options listed below for their scenario. &nbsp;</p><p>If users attempt to post in a community or reply to an existing community post via email after the feature is disabled, they will receive an email notification explaining that the feature is no longer available. All other email related Engage features will remain unaffected. Community posts will still generate email notifications, and users will still be able to reply and react to posts using the Viva Engage Web, Mobile, Teams, and Outlook interactive email experiences. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>Retirement will begin in late May 2024 (previously late April) and is expected to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). We will not be providing extensions for continued use of these retired features. </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>If your organization makes heavy use of post to Viva Engage by sending an email message, they will be impacted by this change and may need to alter business processes. However, we expect minimal impact from this change for most customers.</p><p>After the feature is retired, users can expect to receive a bounce back email with deprecation information if they attempt to create a post by sending an email to the community email address. Additionally, they will receive a similar bounce back email if they attempt to reply to an existing post via email. </p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Whether admin action is required depends upon how the post by email feature is being used in an organization. Most customers will have no action beyond reviewing internal help of guidance that may have been created for end users.</p><p>Admins can use the following examples to identify usage and key stakeholders within their organization, but other scenarios may exist:   </p><ul><li>If you are using an email client such as Outlook as a free form editing experience to create rich media posts, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/MessageCenter?id=MC712149\" target=\"_blank\">Articles</a> feature is the best alternative.  &nbsp;</li><li>When Delayed Delivery in Outlook is used to schedule when posts are sent to a community, the new Viva Engage <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/save-and-schedule-drafts-to-post-later-in-viva-engage-dc806ad9-73bb-49ae-9c68-d800fd902649\" target=\"_blank\">Scheduled Posts</a>  is the best alternative, as it allows scheduling announcements and posts when the audiences are most active. &nbsp;</li><li>Automatic posting workflows may be set up to post new messages, or reply to posts, through email from outside applications. These need to be reviewed and changed to use alternative mechanisms. Posting is possible through the Viva Engage <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/yammer/messages-json-post\" target=\"_blank\">REST API</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/connectors/yammer/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Platform</a>, but admins will need to identify the appropriate solution and make changes for each scenario.</li></ul>",

Thank you for your feedback.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: Direct Media Connection is a new feature that will determine the media connection mode for meetings and 1:1 calls. We are adding a new admin control for admins to choose whether to involve a relay or media processor between meetings and 1:1 calls.\n</p><p>If Direct Media Connection is off, a relay or media processor will transfer the media between participants in meetings and calls. If Direct Media Connection is on, we will try not to include a relay or media processor between the participants in meetings and calls. (Infrequently, if end points are not compatible with setting up a direct connection, we use a relay or media processor.)\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (all environments): We will begin rolling out early April 2024 and expect to complete by late April 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>The Teams client will check the Direct Media Connection setting at the call setup stage. If the setting is False, the Teams client media library will not share the local IP address to the peers, which will force the media connection to be established through a relay server or a media processor server. If the Setting is True, the local IP address will be shared to the peers as a direct connection for better media quality and lower bandwidth usage.</p><p>\n</p><p>Note that as the feature rolls out the default setting for direct media connection as enabled (“on”). The default being \"On\" means all paths will be enabled and customers have the capability to force relay for meetings from admin-controlled config. Although it is not advised as it can impact meeting’s reliability and quality. Direct Media Connection is a user-level policy that admins can set as a tenant default or configure for specific individuals in their tenant. Admins will implement this feature with PowerShell commands.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>As previously communicated in MC679739 <i>Yammer Rebranding to Viva Engage Domain Migration Update</i> (October 2023), the web domain migration of Microsoft Viva Engage is a crucial step in providing a consistent experience. To ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential disruptions to your workflows, we find it necessary to adjust our original timeline.<br></p><p>The new release date for the web domain migration is now set to begin in late March. This decision has been made to safeguard your experience and minimize any potential negative impacts on your daily work. We apologize for any effect that this delay may have caused you.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=180352\" target=\"_blank\">180352</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out in mid-June 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by mid-July 2024 (previously early April). We can't give you an exact date for when the change will roll out to your tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the importance of your workflows. By delaying the release, we can thoroughly test and validate the changes to help guarantee a seamless transition. We ask you to continue following our previous recommendations to prepare for this change, as they remain applicable.</p><p>It's important to note that these release dates are only for the web domain migration. The email sender domain change has not yet been rescheduled. We will announce updates on the email sender domain changes in a future message center post.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your ongoing support and patience as we work diligently to ensure that this change does not disrupt your daily work.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>We will redirect URLs from the old domain (https://web.yammer.com) to the new domain (https://engage.cloud.microsoft/) to ensure uninterrupted access to Viva Engage and related features. These redirects will work with supported browsers and will be retained for the long term, so items like bookmarks should transition seamlessly. Users who are in Viva Engage at the same time as the change rolls out may need to refresh their browsers once to be redirected to the new domain.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Review all places where you may have explicitly configured or hardcoded domain names. Share this information on the domain changes with the relevant admins to give them time to make the necessary changes. Use any changes you have implemented for the old domain as a guide to what you may need to implement for the new domain.  \n</p><p>While these changes are not anticipated to affect our APIs, it is possible that the old domain is hardcoded in a custom application, script, or automation–possibly in an unsupported manner. Review your usage of custom applications and contact your developer or partner for updates.</p><p>Learn more about the rebranding: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/yammer-is-evolving-to-viva-engage/ba-p/3738825#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20all%20of%20Yammer%20will%20evolve%20to,will%20be%20updated%20to%20reflect%20Viva%20Engage%20branding\" target=\"_blank\">Yammer is evolving to Viva Engage - Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">\"Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat\" is a new meeting option that gives the meeting organizer the option to disable copying and sharing features on meeting chat messages for participants to reduce the risk of data leak. Once this restriction is enabled, meeting chat participants will not be able to copy chat messages using menu options or keyboard shortcuts, or forward or share messages to Outlook. There is also a new Meeting Policy setting in Teams admin center for admin to control whether users can see or use this feature in the Meeting Options page. Admins can also set the default value for this meeting option in Meeting Templates that they create. This meeting capability can also be configured within a sensitivity label policy: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/configure-meetings-highly-sensitive-protection\" target=\"_blank\">Configure Teams meetings with protection for highly sensitive data</a>.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=186675\" target=\"_blank\">186675</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-December 2023 and expect to complete within a few days.<br></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2024 and expect to complete within a few days.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late January 2024 and expect to complete by late April 2024 (previously mid-March).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>For users who have a Teams Premium license, \"Turn off copying or forwarding meeting chat\" will show in the Meeting Options page for the meetings they organize. If the organizer turns on the setting or if the meeting is using a sensitivity label or a custom meeting template that turns on this setting, participants will be restricted from copying chat content from the meeting chat. \n</p><p>If an admin does not want certain users to be able to see this option, the admin can go to Teams Admin Center &gt; Meeting Policies and create a policy that disables the feature for these users. Then, these users will not be seeing this setting in the Meeting Options page. However, if the users apply a sensitivity label that enforces copy prevention, it will still take effect even if the policy disables it.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>The Meeting Policy to allow organizers to restrict participants from copying or forwarding meeting chat messages is by default in Teams Admin Center. That means the \"Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat\" Meeting Option will automatically be available to users with a Teams Premium license. \n</p><p>Create/Update any custom meeting template that should have this setting as a meeting option. From Team's Admin Center, admins can control if meeting organizers will have access to control this setting in Meeting Options page for a meeting template. That means \"Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat\" in meeting templates can be hidden or visible to meeting organizers depending on how tenant admin sets it. They can also give control to meeting organizers to override the setting. \n</p><p>The tenant administrator may want to provide end user education in advance for this feature in case end users don't understand why they cannot copy/paste in certain meeting chats.&nbsp;</p>",

URBAC is currently in opt-in mode.&nbsp;<br>The new Service Plan has no impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>\n<p>Microsoft Defender XDR unified role-based access control (URBAC) provides an alternative to traditional Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (MDO/EOP) and Exchange Online (EXO) RBAC.  By default, there are no changes to your security portal permissions.  If you want to enable Unified RBAC, then you must first configure the new URBAC roles for your organization. Once you have configured these roles, then you can enable use of URBAC for ‘Microsoft Defender for Office’ permissions and/or ‘Exchange Online’ permissions.  Doing so replaces your existing RBAC with the new roles.  You can find more information over here - <a href=\"https://aka.ms/M365DRBAC\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Defender Unified role-based access control (RBAC) | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Unified RBAC provides an import roles wizard which will help migrate the permissions from your Microsoft Defender for Office 365 role groups.  It will create URBAC role groups with permissions that mirror the legacy permissions and groups you have already set up.  It will not migrate/replicate Exchange Online permissions – these will require manual configuration in URBAC role groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that URBAC will continue to respect existing Microsoft Entra global roles when you activate the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model for Defender for Office 365. i.e. Global Admins and Security Admins will retain assigned admin privileges.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date. If your alignment report reveals any blockers to migration, you can log an exception with support.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule your migration around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><p><br></p>",

If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain</b>.</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension. This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain.&nbsp;</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are currently working to improve user experience by providing a coherent profile photo experience across Microsoft 365. This primarily impacts those users of SharePoint online (SPO) who neither have an exchange license nor are using Delve for uploading images. This may also impact a small number of SPO admin who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out this change in early October 2023 (previously mid-September) and expect to complete by late June 2024 (previously late March).</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p>Currently, for users who do not have an Exchange License and have uploaded multiple different images across different apps in Microsoft 365, it is likely that SPO displays images uploaded locally in SPO which will be different from User Profile images in other Microsoft 365 apps.\n</p><p>To ensure that the same image is available across all Microsoft 365 experiences, going forward, SPO will display images sourced via MS Graph endpoint from Microsoft People System (MPS). This implies that the image uploaded via other apps in Microsoft 365 will take precedence and get displayed in SPO instead of the locally available image in SharePoint. There is no action required from users at this point.\n</p><p>For users with Exchange licenses there is no functional change.</p><p>To ensure profile coherence, we will disable local uploads from SPO to mysite host and instead enable centralized uploads to Microsoft People System (MPS).<br></p><p><b>What you can do to prepare:</b></p><p>For all users identified above: The profile image will no longer be edited/uploaded through SPO “Edit Profile UI” experience or through “Person Immersive” UI experiences. Instead, all such users would be requested to use the “Universal Me” control available on top right corner of the SharePoint Home page for uploading images. Alternatively, they can also use Delve to upload profile images.\n</p><p>For SPO admins: Admins who upload the user profile image on behalf of the end users will no longer be able to upload images via SPO Admin Centre. Instead, all SPO admins will be requested to upload user profile images via MAC Admin Centre or AAD admin center.\n</p><p>We are providing an early heads-up to ensure our customers have sufficient time to adapt to upcoming changes as we will not be able to grant any extension for this change.</p><p>\n</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated March 27, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://aka.ms/taskpublishinginplanner\" target=\"_blank\">task publishing experience</a>&nbsp;allows frontline organizations to distribute tasks across employees spread across geographically dispersed locations and then monitor how that work is going. Task publishing is available in Microsoft Teams as part of the <i>Tasks by Planner and To Do</i>&nbsp;app, which will soon be renamed to <i>Planner</i>.</p><p>We're releasing several new task publishing features based on top customer requests and feedback:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><b>Recurring task lists</b>. You'll be able to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the cadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish the list and task publishing will automatically send future tasks. We know this will be a time saver for distributing repeat tasks across frontline locations. Common applications are weekly/monthly site inspections and compliance walks or daily opening and closing tasks.\n</li><li><b>Training and policy task lists. </b>You'll be able to create a task list for each member of a recipient team. When you publish the list and choose the recipient teams, a copy of the tasks in the list will be created for and assigned to each member of the recipient teams. This is a great option for training tasks or tasks where employees must acknowledge a new policy.</li><li><b>Form completion requirement.</b>&nbsp;You'll be able to add a form completion requirement to a task, which allows you to create a Microsoft Forms survey that must be completed by a member of each recipient team before that team can complete the task.&nbsp;You can use any Forms question types, including a question that requires a file upload for employees to show their work. You'll be able to centrally review the form submissions across the locations.</li><li><b>Approval completion requirement.&nbsp;</b>Similarly, you'll be able to add an approval completion requirement to a task, which means that the task cannot be approved until an approval of the completed work is requested and granted. The approval can be requested directly from the task details by the user completing the task.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These features will be enabled as part of the rollout of the new Planner experience (more info at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/thenewplanner\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">https://aka.ms/thenewplanner</a>).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=135562\" target=\"_blank\">135562</a>.</p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 (previously mid-March) and expect to complete by mid-April 2024 (previously late March).<br></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>If you are using the task publishing feature, you will see new options when creating task lists and tasks.</p><ul><li>For recurrence options when working with a draft list, you can select <i>Does not recur </i>next to the list title to change the recurrence setting (Screenshot 1 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to create a task list for each team member when you click the <i>New list</i> button (Screenshot 2 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to add a form completion requirement or approval completion requirement to a task after you've created a task in the draft task list.

To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a>\n</p><p>You can also skip tool complexities and finish migration quickly with our 1-day migration guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-1-day-migration\" target=\"_blank\">1-day Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint)</a>\n</p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

Engine versions older than N-2 are no longer supported. Technical support continues to be provided for upgrades from an older engine version to the latest engine version.\n<ul><li>During the technical support (only) phase, commercially reasonable support incidents are handled through Microsoft Customer Service and Support and Microsoft's managed support plans (such as Premier Support). If a support incident requires escalation to development teams for further guidance, requires a non-security update, or requires a security update, customers are asked to upgrade to the latest engine version.</li></ul></li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Please make sure that you have a supported mpengine.dll version installed.

No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment. IT, network, or security admins inside your organization may be able to help identify instances and plan changes. Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

Currently only public teams are searchable in the Teams app. With this label-based control, the admin can create/edit labels in the Compliance portal that allow discoverability of private teams. The private team owner can then apply that label to their team and enable it to appear in a Teams app search. A user cannot join the private team directly but will have to be approved by the owner, which upholds current membership controls. NOTE: For this label-based control to take effect, the admin must turn on<i> Private team discoverability</i> from the Teams Admin Center for scoped users or all users in the tenant, through Teams policies.</li><li><i>Shared Channel controls:</i> These provide access controls to shared channels in a tenant, based on the label applied to the team.&nbsp;<ul><li><i>Restrict to: Internal Only: </i>Select&nbsp;to restrict sharing with internal teams only of the tenant. If not selected, the channel can be shared with external teams, too.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Restrict to: Same label only</i> (for internal teams): Select to restrict sharing with another team that has the same label applied. If not selected, the channel can be shared with different labelled teams too. External sharing is not impacted by this setting. </li><li><i>Restrict to: Private teams only: </i>Applies to internal as well as external sharing.

The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Change gallery size\".\n</li><li>Placement of your own tile: For users who prefer to keep themselves separated from the rest of the participants.

General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q3 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>",

Starting April 30, 2024, we will be retiring the following four cmdlets in the Exchange Online V3 module:<br></p><ol><li>Search-AdminAuditLog</li><li>Search-MailboxAuditLog</li><li>New-AdminAuditLogSearch</li><li>New-MailboxAuditLogSearch</li></ol><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will roll out this change late April 2024 and expect to complete mid-May 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This change will affect your organization if any admin in your tenant is using the above-mentioned cmdlets. After April 30, 2024, you will need to switch to the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/search-unifiedauditlog?view=exchange-ps\" target=\"_blank\">Search-UnifiedAuditLog</a> cmdlet or the <a href=\"https://sip.purview.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview</a> portal to access your audit logs.</p><p>We are retiring these cmdlets to streamline the audit log search experience for our customers. The Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet offers several advantages, including support for a wider variety of record types, more filtering options, and a range of output formats. We recommend using this cmdlet from now on.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>If you are currently using any of the deprecated cmdlets, you will need to take action before April 30, 2024. You can replace Search-AdminAuditLog and Search-MailboxAuditLog with Search-UnifiedAuditLog in your scripts or commands. For New-MailboxAuditLogSearch and New-AdminAuditLogSearch, you will need to use the Microsoft Purview portal to download your audit log report.</p><p>We are also working on a new Audit Search API using Microsoft Graph, which is expected to become available in Public Preview by February 2024. This will allow our customers to programmatically access the new async Audit Search experience.</p><p>Please note that to use the Search-UnifiedAuditLog command, auditing needs to be enabled for your tenant. Auditing is by default only enabled for certain SKUs. If you are using a different SKU, you will need to enable auditing manually by following the steps mentioned here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/audit-log-enable-disable\" target=\"_blank\">Turn auditing on or off</a>.</p><p>We apologize for any inconvenience this change may cause and appreciate your understanding and cooperation. For any additional information please refer to our blog post <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AuditCmdletBlog\" target=\"_blank\">Important Announcement: Deprecation of Search-AdminAuditLog and New-AdminAuditLogSearch cmdlets</a>. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us through our support channels or post a comment on the blog post.</p>",

Stream (Classic) has already been auto disabled for end users, and admins can delay this change till the retirement date. Admins must migrate their tenant's Stream (Classic) data to Stream (on SharePoint) before the retirement date to prevent data loss.</p><p>Stream (Classic)'s successor service, Stream (on SharePoint), entered general availability in October 2022. We recommend that you:\n</p><ul><li>begin using Stream (on SharePoint)\n</li><li>direct your users to upload videos to SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and Yammer\n</li><li>put a plan in place for migration.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Migrating your content from Stream (Classic):\n</p><p>All your existing Stream (Classic) videos can be transferred to Stream (on SharePoint) to take advantage of Stream’s rich integration within Microsoft 365. To support your move to Stream (on SharePoint) we have created migration tool that allows you to transfer your videos to SharePoint while also bringing over metadata, links and permissions associated with your videos.\n</p><p>To begin using the migration tool please refer to our 3-part Migration guide here: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/stream/streamnew/stream-migration-guide-part1\" target=\"_blank\"> Guide to migrate data from Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) - Part 1</a></p><p><b>How this affects your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Stream (on SharePoint) brings your users many of the capabilities of Stream (Classic) while allowing them to record and play videos directly in many everyday work and school apps such as Teams, Office.com, Yammer, Viva, PowerPoint, and SharePoint. In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive. \n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter. \n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).) \n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments. \n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections. \n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links. \n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video. \n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed. \n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations. \n</li></ul><p>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</p><p><b>Learn more:</b></p><p>Below are links to more information about migration and Stream (on SharePoint):\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamMigration\" target=\"_blank\">Stream retirement and timeline</a> overview and migration tool details.\n</li><li>Settings to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/stream/streamnew/migration-settings#save-videos-to-stream-on-sharepoint\" target=\"_blank\">delay Stream (Classic) disablement</a>\n</li><li>IT admin <a href=\"https://aka.ms/NewStream\" target=\"_blank\">overview of Stream (on SharePoint)</a></li><li>Stream (on SharePoint) <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamAdoption\" target=\"_blank\">adoption</a> and <a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamUserGuide\" target=\"_blank\">end user guides.</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://aka.ms/StreamClassicToSPFeatureList\" target=\"_blank\">Stream (Classic) to Stream (on SharePoint) comparison</a>\n</li></ul>",

      "Content": "<p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through May 1, 2024. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

Customers using basic authentication to connect to Exchange on-premises/Exchange Online can continue to use basic authentication without any changes to Exchange.<br></p><p>There is a separate effort to retire Outlook connecting to Exchange Online using Basic Authentication.

The underlying authentication layer for file share is NTLM, and there is not change to NTLM. More information is here - <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/fileio/microsoft-smb-protocol-authentication\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft SMB Protocol Authentication - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn</a>.\n</p><p>Access to files stored on SharePoint on-premises server that are using basic authentication will be blocked. However, files stored on SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business are not affected. Customers who currently store files on web servers that use Basic authentication can move those files to SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint Server on-premises as a solution.\n</p><p><b>Note:</b> This change is only impactful for organizations with on premises servers. If you do not have on premises servers, you can safely disregard this message.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>We will begin rolling this change to Current Channel in August 2023.</p><p>For additional channel timing please review: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/deployoffice/security/basic-authentication-prompts-blocked#versions-of-microsoft-365-apps-affected-by-this-change\" target=\"_blank\">Basic authentication sign-in prompts are blocked by default in Microsoft 365 Apps</a></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Once Basic authentication is disabled in your tenant, users with the Office Version 2307 or higher on their devices will not be able to access resources from servers using Basic authentication.<br></p><p>After the upgrade, end-users will get a Blocking message. If a user tries to open a file stored on a server still using Basic Authentication, Office Client App will block the sign-in prompt and present this pop-up message to the user.</p><p><img src=\"http://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW17X5O?ver=6205\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p><b>Note:</b> Exchange Online team is working on retiring Basic Authentication separately, Outlook will continue to support Basic Authentication with Exchange Online till that work is complete.
