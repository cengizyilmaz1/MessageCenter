Previously, meetings with only transcription enabled saved the transcript file to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online, while meetings with both recording and transcription enabled saved two transcript copies—one that is coupled with the recording saved to OneDrive and another transcript copy saved to the meeting organizer’s Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p>Now with this feature, meetings that have only transcription enabled will also save two copies (one in OneDrive and one in Exchange Online), but all meeting transcript entry points in Teams app will point to the OneDrive copy only, no entry points for meeting transcripts will source from the Exchange Online copy. <i>At the same time</i>, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive only.&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of this feature also improves both the experience of meeting organizers to manually delete the transcript, as well as the ability for IT administrators to apply retention policies to the transcripts from meetings that only had transcription enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the deletion experience for meeting transcripts is captured in the following table:&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><table>\n  <tbody><tr>\n    <th>User</th>\n    <th>Type of transcript deletion</th>\n    <th>Previous experience</th>\n<th>New Experience with this feature rollout</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer </th>\n    <td>Manually from Teams app</td>\n    <td>Only deleted Exchange Online transcript file</td>\n<td>Deletes both copies of the transcript file from OneDrive and Exchange Online</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Meeting organizer/co-organizer</th>\n    <td>Manually from Stream</td>\n    <td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n<td>Only deletes the transcript file stored in OneDrive</td>\n  </tr>\n<tr>\n    <th>IT Administrator</th>\n    <td>Retention policies in Teams Admin Center</td>\n    <td>Only available for copies saved in OneDrive, so only applicable to meetings with recording turned on.</td>\n<td><p>Now the retention policy is also applicable to meetings with only transcription enabled and to the transcript file saved in OneDrive.</p><p> \n \nTo bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">this documentation</a> \n\n</p></td>\n  </tr>\n\n</tbody></table>\n\n<p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=365720\" target=\"_blank\">365720</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b> \n</p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early June 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2024 (previously late May). \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-June 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by late August 2024 (previously mid-August).\n</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-September 2024.\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out late September 2024 and expect to complete by mid-October 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b> \n</p><p>There is no change to the end user experience for viewing and downloading Teams meeting transcripts. The only change for meeting organizers and co-organizers is for any meetings that are held after this feature rolls out, they can delete all copies of the meeting transcript directly from the Teams app, instead of having to manually delete all copies of the transcript from two places (Teams app and Stream). For IT administrators, they can start applying retention policies for the copy of the transcript saved in OneDrive, including scenarios where a meeting only had transcription enabled. This retention policy won’t affect the copies saved in Exchange Online, to bulk delete transcript files saved in Exchange Online—please refer to this <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/delete-exchange-online-transcripts\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.</p><p>We will also update the default transcript permissions. After the rollout, when the new policy is not applied, only meeting organizers and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, and meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams or Microsoft Stream. Regardless of whether the new policy is applied, the meeting organizer will be able to select in Stream the participants who are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript in Stream.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>  \n</p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.

Once you have configured these roles, then you can enable use of URBAC for ‘Microsoft Defender for Office’ permissions and/or ‘Exchange Online’ permissions.  Doing so replaces your existing RBAC with the new roles.

It will not migrate/replicate Exchange Online permissions – these will require manual configuration in URBAC role groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that URBAC will continue to respect existing Microsoft Entra global roles when you activate the Microsoft Defender XDR Unified RBAC model for Defender for Office 365. i.e. Global Admins and Security Admins will retain assigned admin privileges.</p>",

Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1nwuw?ver=dea1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 90 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Similar to app centric management for app availability, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023), admins will be able to install apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.\n</p><p>After rollout, app centric management will replace<i> Installed apps</i> in the Teams admin center and give admins the ability to install apps individually. The <i>Installed apps</i> in your app setup policies will be migrated to app centric management based on your current user and group assignments for each policy.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability: We will begin rolling out in mid-December 2024 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late December 2024 (previously late June).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l8xK?ver=d8ce\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l5Gc?ver=80b1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by late November 2024 (previously late October).\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l3RK?ver=e328\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1l1kz?ver=7fc6\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lbkd?ver=777d\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files.

We have added a link to an article that has more details about the feature.</p><p>The first set of offline capabilities in the new Microsoft Outlook for Windows will be rolling out worldwide in the coming months. Mail, calendar events, and contacts will be saved on the user’s device, so those items can be viewed even when not connected to the internet. Additionally, key actions can be performed on emails, including flag, move, and delete, and new emails can be composed, saved, and sent, so users can stay productive even when not connected to the internet.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=178030\" target=\"_blank\">178030</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 and expect to be complete by late July 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before the rollout: New Outlook had no offline capabilities.\n</p><p><i>After the rollout</i>\n</p><p>Features: Users will have the ability to view mail, calendar events, and contacts in the new Outlook for Windows when not connected to the internet. After a user connects to the internet, actions performed on emails while offline will synchronize back to the server and emails sent while offline will complete sending, moving from the <i>Outbox</i> to <i>Sent Items</i>.\n</p><p>Improved performance: By saving items on the user’s device, the performance of the new Outlook will be improved, because interacting with items saved on the device is faster than interacting with items loaded via a network connection.\n</p><p>Storage impact: Because items are saved on the user’s device, the new Outlook will require more local storage on the user’s device. The storage impact will depend on which folders are saved, how many items are saved, and size of the individual items.\n</p><p>Settings: Users can adjust the folders to save, adjust the number of days of email and calendar events to save, and turn off the feature in new Outlook for Windows &gt; <i>Settings &gt; General &gt; Offline.</i> The feature is enabled by default with these settings:\n</p><ol><li>Folders to save: <i>Inbox, Sent Items, Drafts, Archive, Deleted Items, Snoozed,</i> and <i>Favorites</i> (can be changed to exclude <i>Favorites</i> or include recent folders)\n</li><li>Days of email to save: 7 days (can be increased up to 180 days)\n</li><li>Days of calendar events to save: 30 days (in the past and future) (can be increased up to 180 days)\n</li></ol><p>Features that are not supported when not connected to the internet will display error messages.\n</p><p>Future capabilities: Additional capabilities will be available later in 2024.\n</p><p>Default offline settings in the new Outlook for Windows:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lQAr?ver=481f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No action is required to prepare for this rollout.

When disabled, no items will be saved on the user’s device, which also means users will not receive the performance improvements described in this message. Any items saved prior to disabling the feature will be deleted.\n</p><p>To use <code>OfflineEnabledWin</code>, the mailbox account must be the primary account in the new Outlook.

As part of that change, Viva Engage will return to a simplified topics model, called Engage topics, and the integration with Viva Topics will be retired. \n</p><p>The following premium Viva Topics experiences and lightweight topics management experiences will no longer be available in Viva Engage, including: \n</p><ul><li>Viewing Viva Topics card when hovering on a topic \n</li><li>Viewing or using AI-discovered Viva Topics \n</li><li>Links to Viva Topics pages \n</li><li>Topic management via Viva Topics or lightweight topics management \n</li><li>Featuring of topics in Answers \n</li></ul><p>Using Engage topics, users will continue to be able to create topics, add topics to posts, follow topics, edit topics they created, and increase the relevance of their feeds by following topics. Topic creators will gain the ability to delete topics they created. Applicable admins will continue to be able to edit topics and will gain the ability to delete topics within Viva Engage. \n</p><p>Organizations using Answers in Viva (<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/topic/answers-in-viva-introduction-e6331234-e044-4009-a0c8-7c519a2cf668\" target=\"_blank\">Answers in Viva: Introduction</a>) will continue to see additional topic capabilities including bulk topic deletion for admins, AI suggested topics for questions, topics promoted for following, and topic browse experiences. The described topic experiences will be available to Viva Engage tenants that have been migrated to Engage topics.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Rollout will begin August 2024 and will complete for all tenants migrated to use Viva Topics in Viva Engage by April 2025. Tenants using legacy topics in Viva Engage will begin migrations in September 2024 and migrations will continue until all Native mode networks have been completed.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>Why is this change happening?</b> \n</p><p>As a result of the retirement of Viva Topics, Viva Engage will retire the integration with Viva Topics, but continue to support a simplified topics model to help organize, amplify, route, and recall knowledge posted with topics. To ensure customer data is retained we will migrate customer topics data from Viva Topics into Viva Engage to preserve topics applied to posts and associated Engage topic metadata such as followers, description and creator. \n</p><p>During the transition, we will stop topics migrations to use Viva Topics and Topics lightweight management but continue by-request migrations that enable Viva Engage networks to use Answers in Viva (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/eac-answers-overview-set-up#technical-requirements\" target=\"_blank\">Technical requirements</a>).

Tenants will be migrated in batches after their Viva Topics license expires or after the Viva Topics retirement date of February 22, 2025, whichever comes first. If your tenant is impacted, notice of topic migration will be shared via message center post approximately one month before topic migration.</p><p>Migrations for legacy topics experiences (tenants not yet migrated to Viva Topics) will kick off in September&nbsp;2024 and continue until all Viva Engage networks in Native mode have migrated to Engage topics.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b> \n</p><p>Before the migration a tenant admin can get a snapshot of which topics will be migrated by exporting topics in Viva Engage with PowerShell (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/topics/export-topics-powershell?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Export topics created in Viva Engage with PowerShell</a>).

This migration will not impact your profiles, the configured settings and values will be brought over as they are currently saved. This will not impact the state of enforcement of policy on users' devices.</p><p>Following the migration, you will observe a revised placement of some templates within the user interface. Certain templates will become exclusively configurable within the Settings catalog moving forward. For other templates, the next time the upgraded policy is edited, you will also notice a new policy editing experience, improved reporting and handling of setting values to \"not configured.”</p><p>If you are interacting with device configuration profiles via the deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations Microsoft Graph API, you will be able to continue creating new policies, but they will later be migrated. Once migrated, the new policies will have new PolicyIDs and are created on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/intune-deviceconfigv2-devicemanagementconfigurationpolicy-get?view=graph-rest-beta\" target=\"_blank\">deviceManagement/configurationPolicies</a> API. We recommend switching to the new graph endpoints for policy creation as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Note:</b> You may see a slight change in reporting numbers when these policies are migrated.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>On August 1, 2024, the new Microsoft Outlook for Windows will transition from the Preview phase to General Availability for commercial accounts. This milestone will not affect existing users who continue to use classic Outlook for Windows; however, GA status helps organizations move forward with their migration plans. A future announcement will cover General Availability for US Government clouds (GCC, GCC High, and DoD) and availability in other sovereign clouds.<br></p><p>The new Outlook continues to be an opt-in experience. Please note that this update does not change any settings for your organization, will not automatically switch users from the classic version of Outlook for Windows, and will not introduce any disruptive changes.

      "Content": "<p>Updated July 5, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Soon, on Windows and macOS devices running the OneDrive sync app, we will enable a new feature called “Offline mode” that will allow you to continue working with the OneDrive web app in your browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) or Microsoft Teams even when you are offline. This feature will be on by default and will give your users the ability to view, rename, move, copy their files, and create new folders when offline. Users will be able to open their files that are available offline on users’ device in a native app directly from inside OneDrive on the web. All of the metadata changes users make offline to their files in the browser will be automatically synced back to OneDrive when Internet connection is restored, and users can resolve conflicts, if there are any. As an administrator, you’ll be able to control various aspects of Offline mode using the Group Policies outlined in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/use-group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time. A copy of user’s file metadata that powers OneDrive for web is securely stored locally on user’s device. These data on user’s device are only available and accessible by that user. If someone else were to sign in on your device, these local data on the device wouldn't be available to them.<br></p><p>A secure local web server on user’s device will handle the operations that users perform on their files in OneDrive for web, such as viewing, sorting, renaming, moving, and copying where traditionally these operations would need to be handled by the OneDrive cloud service. This allows to eliminate network as the bottleneck when loading and working with OneDrive for web resulting in fast and smooth interactions with users’ files like loading your files and folders, sorting, renaming, moving, renaming, and more. And all of these operations will continue to work even when users are offline, lose internet connection, or run into a service disruption.<br></p><ul><li>OneDrive Offline mode lets you work on OneDrive when offline in the browser, OneDrive PWA (Progressive Web App) and in Microsoft Teams, improves performance on all kinds of networks, and helps alleviate throttling related to working with large file collections.</li><li>OneDrive Offline mode is currently supported on Windows devices (Windows 10 or later) and macOS devices (macOS 12 Monterey or later) that have the OneDrive sync app installed and on Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome)<br></li><li>Offline mode will be on by default for user’s OneDrive on the web and both users and administrators will have the option to disable Offline mode for their OneDrive.<br></li><li>Offline mode is a per-device setting (configured separately for every device users use to access OneDrive on the web.<br></li><li>The data is securely stored in a local database under the user’s profile directory and requests are handled through a secure localhost HTTP server. Offline mode is powered by a separate background process (Microsoft.SharePoint.exe).<br></li><li>When Offline mode is on, users will see a new icon in the top navigation bar in OneDrive on the web.<br></li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168618\" target=\"_blank\">168618</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Worldwide: We will begin gradually rolling out in late February 2024 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete in late August 2024 (previously late June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b><br></p><p>When this feature becomes enabled for users in your organization and the user then visits OneDrive for web, Offline mode will be set up for the first time.

After Offline mode is set up, only changes to users’ file metadata will result in upload or download activity over the network. Users can continue working with OneDrive on the web as before and they can choose to turn off Offline mode if they desire to do so.

If you are currently following this guidance, this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q4 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.\n</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>",

Some malicious actors have used free Teams trials to launch phishing or abuse attacks against Teams users. With this setting you can add another layer of protection for users against some of these attacks.\n</p><p>By default, this new setting will block external access with trial-only tenants 30 days after the rollout is complete and will require explicit action from you if you wish to continue to federate with trial tenants.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): Available now.\n</p><p>Blocking external access with trial-only tenants based on this setting will occur on July 29, 2024.

When set to <code>Blocked</code>, all external access with users from Teams subscriptions that contain only trial licenses will be blocked. This means users from these trial-only tenants will not be able to search or reach your users via chats, Teams calls, and meetings (using the users' authenticated identity) and your users will not be able to reach users in these trial-only tenants. If this setting is set to <code>Blocked</code>, users from the trial-only tenant will also be removed from any existing chats. The default setting will be to block external access with trial-only tenants.\n</p><p><i>Important Notes</i></p><ul><li>A \"trial-only\" tenant is defined as a tenant with a Teams service plan that has only Trial subscriptions (0 purchased licenses).\n</li><li>Shared Channels, Guest access and Anonymous Meeting joins will not be affected by this setting.\n</li><li>This new setting only controls external communication with trial-only tenants within the same Microsoft 365 cloud environment. When enforcement starts, users from trial-only tenants will be blocked by default from external communication with users in other Microsoft 365 cloud environments and with Microsoft Skype for Business server users. No admin control will exist to allow cross-cloud external communication with trial tenants.\n</li><li>If your tenant has enabled <i>Allow only specific domains</i> and specified domains in the Allow list, and if <code>-ExternalAccessWithTrialTenants</code> is set to <code>Blocked</code>, trial-only tenants in the Allow list will be blocked. If this setting is set to <code>Allowed</code>, all domains in the Allow list will be allowed.\n</li><li>If your tenant has enabled <i>Block all external domains,</i> the <code>-ExternalAccessWithTrialTenants</code> setting has no impact.\n</li><li>If your tenant has enabled <i>Block specific domains</i> and specified domains in the Block list, and if the <code>-ExternalAccessWithTrialTenants</code> setting is set to <code>Blocked</code>, trial-only tenants not in the Block list will also be blocked. If set to <code>Allowed</code>, this setting has no impact.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review your settings for external access to determine if you need to change the default value for this new setting.

To learn more about COM and web add-ins, see <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins\" target=\"_blank\">Office Add-ins platform overview</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/deployoffice/outlook/get-started/migrate-com-to-web-addins\" target=\"_blank\">Migrate from COM to web add-ins</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>To help facilitate the migration of users to web add-ins and avoid any disruption to their productivity, we curated a list of COM add-ins that have equivalent web add-ins that are available today. <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/b85ce5ff-bef3-45ae-9e95-9d63c514abdc\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Review the full list of these add-ins</a>.</p><p>When a user switches from classic Outlook to new Outlook for Windows, they go through a series of steps to help them get set up. As part of this onboarding process, a user can consent to install equivalent web add-ins from their existing COM add-ins from the curated list.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1m64h?ver=24ee\" style=\"width: 475px;\"><br></p><p>If the user has a COM add-in from the curated list and selects <i>Import Settings</i>, the web add-in is installed in new Outlook for Windows. If the user selects <i>Skip</i>, no web add-ins equivalents are installed for the user.&nbsp;</p><p>This feature is available for all users by default, including users blocked from the Store.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To opt out of this feature, set the following Group Policy Object (GPO) setting to <i>Enabled </i>by mid-July 2024: <i>Disable web add-in installation on migration to new Outlook for Windows</i>. For more information, see <a href=\"https://aka.ms/newOutlookSettingsGPO\" target=\"_blank\">Install web add-in counterparts of existing COM add-ins in new Outlook for Windows</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>These equivalent web add-ins are identified as user-installed add-ins. If you’re looking to deploy a web add-in as an admin-installed add-in, you can deploy it through Integrated Apps and hide the COM add-in using the following GPO to avoid duplication: <i>Deactivate Outlook web add-ins whose equivalent COM or VSTO add-in is installed</i>. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/make-office-add-in-compatible-with-existing-com-add-in#group-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Make your Office Add-in compatible with an existing COM add-in</a>.</p><p>The user can also <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/1ee261f9-49bf-4ba6-b3e2-2ba7bcab64c8\" target=\"_blank\">directly install add-ins from the Store</a> once they move to new Outlook for Windows.

Due to this, the attachments currently do not show up with the Engage messages in the eDiscovery review sets.

Going forward, instead of the link to the location in Engage backend, we will ingest the link to the SharePoint site location where the attachment is stored. As a result, this link will open the attachment from its SharePoint location. There are several benefits to this solution enhancement:<br></p><ol><li>aligns Engage with other products (such as Teams) in terms of eDiscovery data access.\n</li><li>streamlines how attachments within a conversation show up as nested items under that conversation in the review set, making it easier for analysis as well as export.\n</li><li>displays the correct name of the attachments (consistent with as it is shown in review set) when retrieved through SharePoint location.\n</li><li>is more robust, scalable, and reliable for electronic discovery purposes.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1mIHs?ver=8ac0\" style=\"width: 400px;\"><br></p><p>Once the solution is GA, any new Engage message with attachment that is ingested to eDiscovery will have the SharePoint links to the attachments with them (instead of Engage links). This will not change anything with the records that have already been ingested to eDiscovery.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Please do take note of the following scenarios:\n</p><ol><li>An existing message in a conversation is edited (content is edited, but attachment is unchanged\n</li><li>An existing message in a conversation is edited, along with the attachments (attachment is updated or new attachment is added)\n</li><li>A new message with an attachment is posted in an existing conversation.\n</li></ol><p>In all the above scenarios, any new version of the messages will be ingested to eDiscovery with the SharePoint links to the attachments.

With this rollout, we're expanding the ability to enable or disable approvals on any list.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-May 2024 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late May 2024 (previously early May).\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 (previously late May) and expect to complete by mid-August 2024 (previously mid-June).\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Users will be able to configure <i>Approvals</i> by going to the <i>Automate</i> dropdown from the command bar in SharePoint Online lists or in the Microsoft Lists app. Approvals will be actioned and available from Microsoft Teams. Note that disabling approvals will only hide the relevant columns and in-progress approvals will still be actionable in Teams. At any time, you can manually add approvals columns back into views.\n</p><p>After <i>Approvals</i> are enabled, a user can create a list item and submit it for approval. By creating an approval request and specifying the approver, the request will appear in the Approvals app in Teams or can be approved directly within the list. Once approved, the list item status is updated.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Inform your users of the new <i>Approvals</i> functionality for lists and include <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/approvals-in-lists-2bd0954d-5797-4be3-b78a-846f26338e17\" target=\"_blank\">Approvals in Lists - Microsoft Support</a> in your end-user documentation and support process.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through January 1, 2025. You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

These changes happen on different schedules and may impact you differently.<br></p><p>Changes to our web domain are currently not anticipated to impact our APIs. Should there be any changes in the future we will notify you.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=180352\" target=\"_blank\">180352</a></p><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><ul><li>Web domain change: Rollout will begin in late March 2024 and is expected to be complete by mid-April 2024.</li><li>Email domain change: We will communicate a new timeline when we are ready to proceed.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Web Domain</p><ul><li>During rollout, the web domain will change for all tenants from https://web.yammer.com to engage.cloud.microsoft. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.<br></li><li>Admins need to prepare for this change because the old URL may be saved in bookmarks, linked from intranet pages, or configured in network devices like proxies. We will indefinitely redirect URLs to the new domain ensuring uninterrupted access in many cases, but you must review any domain usage specific to your environment. It is not possible for us to identify all places within your environment where redirections may not function correctly. Users may initially need to refresh their browsers to receive the redirect if they are using Viva Engage once the change occurs.</li><li>Most attention is required to other usage of the old domain which may be hardcoded in a network proxy or security system. It is not possible for Microsoft to identify instances like these which exist inside your environment. IT, network, or security admins inside your organization may be able to help identify instances and plan changes. Check your configuration for desktop and mobile browsers because they may be different.</li></ul><p>Email Domain</p><ul><li><i>The sender domain used in emails from Viva Engage will start changing from @yammer.com to @engage.mail.microsoft.</i> This phased change to emails will continue until all Viva Engage email notifications and digests use the new sender domain. No admin action is required to initiate the change, and it is not possible to opt-out of this change.</li><li>Preparation for this change will depend on how you use the sender domain. If you have made specific customizations for the old domain in the past, then you may need to replicate the change for the new domain. If the old domain has been configured in transport rules, or an email gateway, then the new domain will need to be added. End users may need to update rules in Outlook. The impact will depend upon how you use the sender domain, so you will need to review your mail configuration and communicate with end users.</li><li>This change may go unnoticed by most users unless they have specific Outlook rules based on the sender domain.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59\" target=\"_blank\">Outlook rules can be updated</a> to use the new domain without admin intervention, but you will need to communicate that the change is coming. <i>Moving to engage.mail.microsoft eliminates the need for yammer.com rules.

These new features will streamline the process of managing Sent items, particularly for admins who use <i>Soft delete</i> and <i>Move to inbox </i>actions.\n</p><p><i>Key Features</i>\n</p><ul><li>Integration with <i>Soft delete</i>: Sender's copy clean-up will be incorporated as part of the <i>Soft delete</i> action.\n</li><li>Wide support: This action will be supported across various Defender XDR platforms including Threat Explorer, Take Action wizard from the email entity, Summary Panel, Advanced hunting, and through Microsoft Graph API.\n</li><li>Undo capability: An undo action will be available, allowing you to reverse the clean-up by moving items back to the Sent folder.\n</li></ul><p>Note: Sender's copy clean-up will apply to intra-organization emails and outbound emails, ensuring that only the sender's copy is soft deleted for these emails and inbound messages are out of scope.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out end of May 2024 and expect to complete by late July 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, admins did not have a way to remove harmful emails from a sender's Sent items.\n</p><p>After rollout: This step-by-step scenario explains the functionality of Sender's copy clean-up:\n</p><p>You as the admin have already investigated in Threat Explorer, email entity, or Advanced hunting and have selected entities to remediate.\n</p><p>1. Create remediation: After your entity selection, you choose an action and create the remediation. For the <i>Soft delete</i> action, these items will be visible in the <i>Take action</i> wizard:\n</p><ul><li>Checkbox for <i>Sender's copy</i>. Select this option to clean the messages from sender's Sent folder.\n</li><li>Email count: Displays the number of emails submitted. This count will reflect sender’s copy as well.\n</li><li>Sender’s entities in a separate tab.\n</li></ul><p>2. As the remediation begins, the approval ID to track the action is displayed (Note: This is the same as before the rollout.)\n</p><p>3. Track the remediation status: The Unified Action Center (<i>Actions &amp; submissions &gt; Action center &gt; History</i>) contains all the approved actions. You can open any manual remediation action entry in Action center to:\n</p><ul><li>View the email count: This count will be same as submitted email count.\n</li><li>Review the action logs: The email count and action logs will reflect the status of remediable, non-remediable, failed, and timed-out emails, including the sender's copy.\n</li><li>Export action logs: The export feature will include the new column <i>IsSendersCopy</i> to capture the sender entities and corresponding action status.\n</li></ul><p>4. Undo sent items. The undo capability ensures that you have greater control and flexibility when managing email remediation, providing a safety net for actions taken in error or needing revision. Select the checkbox for <i>Move to Inbox</i> to trigger undo for the recipient copy and previously deleted sender’s copy of a message.\n</p><p>From Advanced hunting: The <i>Delete sender's copy</i> option under Delete email &gt; Soft delete:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lmWn?ver=d0cc\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>From Threat Explorer: The <i>Delete sender's copy </i>option under Move to mailbox folder &gt; Soft delete:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lsiw?ver=bd28\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>From Threat Explorer: The <i>Undo sender's copy</i> option under Move to mailbox folder &gt; Inbox:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1lsix?ver=e89f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">We are introducing a revamped version of the gallery in Teams meetings and calls. The new gallery will be the default view when users join their meetings, so that they can use it without the need of taking an action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=118467\" target=\"_blank\">118467</a></p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2024 (previously early January) and expect to complete by early February 2024 (previously mid-January).\n</p><p>Production and GCC: We will begin rolling out early July 2024 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by mid-July 2024 (previously late February).</p><p>GCC High: We will begin rolling mid-July 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously early March).\n</p><p>DoD: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2024 (previously late February) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously early March).</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>\n\n<p>This new version introduces a series of changes to help users in their meetings:</p><ul><li>16:9 aspect ratio participant tiles for more predictability. A consistent aspect ratio maintains a more predictable experience when users turn their videos on or off. It also provides more visibility into users' body language and hand gestures.\n</li><li>An audio-video mixed gallery for a more inclusive representation. Audio and video users share now the same space by default.\n</li><li>Meeting rooms are displayed larger than individual participants. In certain meeting sizes, we display Microsoft Teams Rooms video in a larger size than the rest of the participants to give an equivalent weight to participants joining from a meeting room. Non-Teams rooms joining Teams meeting via Direct Guest Join will remain the same tile size as today.\n</li><li>You appear next to the rest of the participants. Your own tile will now be included next to the rest of the participants.\n</li><li>Customization of the gallery. Users can adapt the gallery to their needs or preferences. The customization options include:\n<ul><li>Gallery size: Users can choose the maximum number of tiles that will be represented per page. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Change gallery size\".\n</li><li>Placement of your own tile: For users who prefer to keep themselves separated from the rest of the participants. If chosen, the self-tile will be placed in an area separate from the rest of the participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"More options\" &gt; \"Remove me from gallery\".\n</li><li>Prioritizing videos: For users who want to give a higher weight to participants with their video on. If chosen, video participants will be displayed more prominently than audio participants. The entry point for this action is available through the meeting toolbar: \"View\" &gt; \"Prioritize video\".\n</li><li>Meeting room tile size: Users can decide if they want to resize the meeting room tile to the same size as the rest of the participants. The entry point for this action is available in the contextual menu of the room tile.</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eytq?ver=619f\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1evPM?ver=9b49\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eDDx?ver=8083\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Please notify your users about this change and update any training documentation, as appropriate.<br></p>",

We will communicate via Message center when we are ready to proceed.</p><p style=\"margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in\">Today, we are announcing that, beginning in January 2025, Exchange Online will begin enforcing an external recipient rate limit of 2000 recipients in 24 hours.</p><p>Exchange Online does not support bulk or high-volume transactional email. We have not enforced limiting of bulk email until now, but we plan on doing so with the introduction of an External Recipient Rate (ERR) limit. The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center, and who have maintained a single app setup policy in Teams that has a modified Installed apps section.\n</li><li>Phase 3: We will update this post with a timeline and more details. This phase applies to all remaining tenants.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. <b>For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)</b>.</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: Phase 2 and 3 tenant administrators will have access to an on-demand report prior to the merging of app settings. This report is designed to help administrators assess the impact of merge rules on their tenant and make any adjustments in advance. We will update this MC post when the report is available.\n</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

It is also possible for users to edit their profile data in the SharePoint profile edit experience (editprofile.aspx). \n</li><li>Organizational view – exists in the Profile Card and as a dedicated experience in Org Explorer\n</li><li>Favorites – favorites on Office.com and OneDrive is not connected to Delve and is a good option for users with similar functionality and improved availability. \n</li><li>Boards – will not be replaced.\n</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>December 16, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>You are receiving this message because Delve web is available to most customers in Microsoft 365.

Please note that Delve and the new edit profile experience will work side by side until Delve is retired. \n</p><p>Users will no longer be able to create new boards, add documents to existing boards, view boards or search for boards when this change is implemented. Please note that documents themselves will NOT be removed. It is only the association with one or multiple boards that will be removed.\n</p><p>The new edit profile experience will for now read and write to the same source as Delve does, thus there are no changes in how admins can modify user profile properties.<br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>We recommend updating internal documentation and training related to Delve with the suggested alternatives.

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events.

This provides commercial customers with a 12-month window to prepare for the retirement and transition off Teams Live Events.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>September 30, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After September 30, 2024, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Which is why we allow co-organizer to be added to the event so they can work alongside or on behalf of the organizer. So far co-organizers were able to set up event theming, manage registration, meeting options, view reports and more but were not able to edit event details like title, date/time, description, event group; nor publish or cancel event. Now they can! Co-organizer can edit event details, publish, and cancel the event like the organizer can. So once the co-organizer is added they will have full parity of experience as organizer and control/manage/edit event.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168524\" target=\"_blank\">168524</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted release: We will begin rolling out early October 2024 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-October 2024 (previously mid-June).</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 (previously mid-June) and expect to complete by early November 2024 (previously early July).<br></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When co-organizer opens the event scheduling page, they should have the ability to edit the details page, publish, and cancel the event.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Nothing required to prepare.</p>",

Users can easily revert to an older version if business needs change or if files are damaged by user error or malware. Version storage controls allow you as admins to set an appropriate level of recoverability and auditability for your organization. Based on strong customer feedback, we will release enhanced version storage controls so you can meet your needs efficiently and at scale.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=145802\" target=\"_blank\">145802</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out early May 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.

Please make sure that your SharePoint Online Management Shell is updated to version 16.0.24810.12000 or higher so you can run the specified cmdlets. For guidance, refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online\" target=\"_blank\">Get started with the SharePoint Online Management Shell</a>.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late August 2024 and expect to complete by mid-October 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>What’s New?\n</p><p>We are introducing new version controls that help admins and content owners reduce storage footprint driven by low value file versions. Previously, document library owners could set count-based version limits at the library level. With this rollout, we are introducing new automatic version limits that consider important factors such as age and restore probability to offer more intelligent version deleting&nbsp;options. We’re also adding manual settings for version expiration and count limits.\n</p><p>Here is a summary of the new capabilities introduced with this rollout:\n</p><ul><li><i>New Version history limit</i> options to meet your organization’s recovery objectives and version storage targets. Set version limits to:\n<ul><li><i>Automatically optimize</i> version recovery and storage without estimating limits; or\n</li><li><i>Manually limit</i> versions by count or version age.\n</li></ul></li><li><i>Set default organization Version history limits</i> on new document libraries and Microsoft OneDrive accounts for consistent version storage setting on all new libraries and OneDrive accounts created through the organization.\n</li><li><i>Set Site or Library level Version history limits</i> to meet specific content needs by breaking inheritance from organization defaults.\n</li><li><i>Report on version storage use of a site or library</i> by generating a CSV report to analyze current usage trends or impact analysis.\n</li><li><i>Delete versions from a site or library</i> to reduce existing version storage footprint or align with new limits.\n</li></ul><p>After this rollout completes, you can expect these changes:\n</p><p>1. New <i>Version history limits</i> settings in SharePoint admin center: Admins can set global defaults for all new libraries created in the organization. By default, the organization-level <i>Version history</i> limit will be set to M<i>anually</i> delete versions. Within the Manual limits, the default <i>Number of major versions</i> is set to 500 and the <i>Time</i> period is set to <i>Never expire.</i>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1h5nt?ver=1a35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>2. New <i>Version time limit</i> setting for Document libraries: In addition to existing <i>Version count limits</i>, users can set <i>Version time limits</i> to delete versions based on age. <i>Version time limits</i> will be on the library's <i>Version settings</i> page. No change will be made to existing version limits applied to the library.\n</p><p>3. New <i>Expiring in</i> column on a file's <i>Version history</i> view: Users will be able to:\n</p><ul><li>View an expiration applied to a file's versions based on the library settings\n</li><li>Set individual file versions to never expire\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>Review updated documentation:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/document-library-version-history-limits\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"\">Overview of Version History Limits for Document Libraries and OneDrive</a></li><li>End user documentation: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-and-configure-versioning-for-a-list-or-library-1555d642-23ee-446a-990a-bcab618c7a37\" target=\"_blank\">Enable and configure versioning for a list or library</a>\n</li></ul><p>To send feedback or questions about this change, select <i>Like</i> or <i>Dislike</i> at the top of this message in the Microsoft 365 message center.</p>",

If you are currently following this guidance,<i> this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain</i>.</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing. </li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online.

In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date. If your alignment report reveals any blockers to migration, you can log an exception with support.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule your migration around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><p><br></p>",

This can be found in the ‘New Meeting’ drop down in Teams Calendar.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>You may consider updating your internal documentation to mention that this feature is being replaced by a new way of creating webinars.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://aka.ms/taskpublishinginplanner\" target=\"_blank\">task publishing experience</a>&nbsp;allows frontline organizations to distribute tasks across employees spread across geographically dispersed locations and then monitor how that work is going. Task publishing is available in Microsoft Teams as part of the <i>Tasks by Planner and To Do</i>&nbsp;app, which will soon be renamed to <i>Planner</i>.</p><p>We're releasing several new task publishing features based on top customer requests and feedback:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><b>Recurring task lists</b>. You'll be able to set recurrence on a draft task list, which will allow you to choose the cadence (such as every month on the 15th of the month). You can then publish the list and task publishing will automatically send future tasks. We know this will be a time saver for distributing repeat tasks across frontline locations. Common applications are weekly/monthly site inspections and compliance walks or daily opening and closing tasks.\n</li><li><b>Training and policy task lists. </b>You'll be able to create a task list for each member of a recipient team. When you publish the list and choose the recipient teams, a copy of the tasks in the list will be created for and assigned to each member of the recipient teams. This is a great option for training tasks or tasks where employees must acknowledge a new policy.</li><li><b>Form completion requirement.</b>&nbsp;You'll be able to add a form completion requirement to a task, which allows you to create a Microsoft Forms survey that must be completed by a member of each recipient team before that team can complete the task.&nbsp;You can use any Forms question types, including a question that requires a file upload for employees to show their work. You'll be able to centrally review the form submissions across the locations.</li><li><b>Approval completion requirement.&nbsp;</b>Similarly, you'll be able to add an approval completion requirement to a task, which means that the task cannot be approved until an approval of the completed work is requested and granted. The approval can be requested directly from the task details by the user completing the task.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These features will be enabled as part of the rollout of the new Planner experience (more info at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/thenewplanner\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">https://aka.ms/thenewplanner</a>).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=135562\" target=\"_blank\">135562</a>.</p>\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>\n\n<p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early April 2024 (previously mid-March) and expect to complete by mid-April 2024 (previously late March).<br></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2024 (previously late March) and expect to complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>\n\n<p>If you are using the task publishing feature, you will see new options when creating task lists and tasks.</p><ul><li>For recurrence options when working with a draft list, you can select <i>Does not recur </i>next to the list title to change the recurrence setting (Screenshot 1 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to create a task list for each team member when you click the <i>New list</i> button (Screenshot 2 below).</li><li>You'll see the option to add a form completion requirement or approval completion requirement to a task after you've created a task in the draft task list.

In addition, Stream (on SharePoint) also enables you and your users to:\n</p><ul><li>Easily manage video files with the same security, admin controls, multi-geo support, compliance (eDiscovery, legal hold, retention, and data loss prevention policies), permissions, and sharing controls as the rest of your files in SharePoint and OneDrive.\n</li><li>Record videos with advanced tools directly in the camera like background blur or replace, inking, text, audio only, and teleprompter.\n</li><li>Search for videos anywhere in Microsoft 365. You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

You can now find videos and Teams meeting recordings across Microsoft 365 by searching keywords.\n</li><li>Find what you need quickly on the Stream start page in Office. The new start page shows recent, shared, and favorite videos, with playlists coming soon. (Note: The Stream start page doesn't show you videos in Stream (Classic).)\n</li><li>View Teams Meeting Recordings with transcripts, chapters, timeline markers, speaker attribution, and comments.\n</li><li>Create custom page, site, and portal experiences to feature videos as part of your intranet and Viva Connections.\n</li><li>Share videos the same way you would any other file in Microsoft 365 with support for Guests, People in your Organization links, or unauthenticated external sharing with “anyone” links.\n</li><li>Get analytics per video, for all the videos in a site, or see who has watched your video.\n</li><li>Add videos to the Viva Connections Feed.\n</li><li>Use APIs based on the Microsoft Graph Files API for basic video file operations.\n</li><li>These benefits add up to ease of video management for admins and more productivity for your teams.</li></ul>",

This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s announcement and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.\n</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph\n</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:\n</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Access to Public Folders – We are reviewing the need to provide third-party app access to Exchange Online public folders via the Graph API and are interested in hearing from customers and partners who build solutions that use public folders, other than backup and restore solutions. If you are willing to share details on how you use EWS with public folders, we’d love to hear from you, and you can reach us at <a href=\"mailto:EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">EWSandPFfeedback@microsoft.com</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to provide feedback to us, keep a close eye on the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/whats-new-overview\" target=\"_blank\">What’s new in Microsoft Graph</a> page, and explore alternatives for functionality or features not available in Microsoft Graph.\n</p><p>Next Steps\n</p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and this blog for related content.\n</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

We are making this change because basic authentication is a legacy authentication method that sends a username and password with each request. As a result, an attacker can access these credentials and use them to access resources. Continued use of Basic Authentication is a big security concern, so we have decided to deprecate it from all tenants.</p><p>\n</p><p>We will retire this feature in Office Apps version 2307+. Instead, we recommend moving to a more secure authentication method, preferably Modern Authentication, and enabling multi-factor authentication based on OAuth2.0 token-based auth.<br></p><p>This retirement will not affect Exchange Online and Exchange on-premises. Customers using basic authentication to connect to Exchange on-premises/Exchange Online can continue to use basic authentication without any changes to Exchange.<br></p><p>There is a separate effort to retire Outlook connecting to Exchange Online using Basic Authentication.
