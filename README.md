# Microsoft 365 Message Center Archive

This site is a simple archive of the Microsoft 365 Message Center. It is updated daily and provides a simple way to search and view the Message Center posts.

I created this site so I can link to it from my weekly newsletter [Entra.News](https://entra.news) so folks could ready the message center post without having to log into the admin center.

> [!CAUTION]  
> This site is for reference only. Always refer to your tenant's Microsoft 365 message center post for the most accurate information that is relevant to your tenant.
> * Not all posts are visible to all tenants.
> * This archive uses a tenant that has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription. Your tenant may have different features and updates.
