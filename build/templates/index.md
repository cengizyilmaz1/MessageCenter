👋 Hey folks,

This site is a searchable archive of all the messages in the Microsoft 365 Message Center. It is updated daily with the latest messages from the Message Center.

I created this as a companion site to [Entra.News](https://entra.news), my weekly newsleter that brings you all the latest on Microsoft Entra. It's awesome, if you work with Microsoft 365 you should subscribe 😉.

In my newsletter I include links to Message Center posts, but not everyone has access to the Microsoft 365 admin center. So I created this site to be accessible by anyone!

Notes:

* While I am a Microsoft employee, this is a personal project and is not affiliated in any way with Microsoft.
* This site does not include all the messages you see in your tenant and it could list messages that are not visible in your tenant.
* Always refer to the Message Center in your admin portal for the most accurate information specific to your tenant.

Cheers,
