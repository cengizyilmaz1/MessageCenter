Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">Emails for Webinars are critical to engage with registrants and often organizers feel the need to customize the content. To enable this,&nbsp;we are rolling out two features.&nbsp;<br></p>\n<ol><li>The content of the emails (i.e. all webinar related attendee emails) can be edited by the event organizers. This is reserved for Teams Premium licensed organizers.&nbsp;</li><li>Time to send reminder emails can be configured by the event organizers. This is reserved for Teams Premium licensed organizers.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>\n</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=119391\" target=\"_blank\">119391</a><br></p>\n\n<p>[When this will happen:]<br></p>\n\n<p>Standard Release: rollout will start in mid-July and expected to be completed by end of July.</p><p>GCC: rollout will start in mid-November 2023 (previously mid-October) and expected to be completed by late February 2024 (previously late January).</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]<br></p>\n\n<p>Email customization is governed by IT admin policy to enable admins to restrict organizers with Teams Premium license from being able to edit the content of the emails.
