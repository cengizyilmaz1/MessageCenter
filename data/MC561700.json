    "Content": "<p>Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Users think about which tasks they need to complete, such as creating a survey, inside Microsoft Teams. Soon, app suggestions will be organized by tasks that the apps support as opposed to conventional categories (productivity, project management). As a result, the new categorization will reduce the amount of time users need to spend learning about these apps â€“ helping them to work more effectively.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=122527\" target=\"_blank\">122527</a><br></p>\n\n<p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Standard: Rollout will begin in early Apr 2024 (previously early March) and is expected to be complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).\n</p><p>GCC: Rollout will begin in early May 2024 (previously early April) and is expected to be complete by early June 2024 (previously early May).\n</p><p>GCC High: Rollout will begin in early June 2024 (previously early May) and is expected to be complete by early July 2024 (previously early June).</p><p> </p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]<br></p>\n\n<p>The task-based app suggestions will be added to the Tabs, Messaging Extension, and Bots in-context Stores. \n\n</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW14R3P?ver=8e35\" style=\"width: 400px;\" \"alt=\"current\" app=\"\" suggestions=\"\" categories=\"\" view\"=\"\">&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW14BuJ?ver=fbff\" style=\"width: 400px;\" \"alt=\"new\" app=\"\" suggestions=\"\" categories=\"\" view\"=\"\"><br></p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]<br></p>\n<p>There is no action required at this time.
