Additionally, due to the inevitable generative AI learning curve, you may want to provide additional training/documentation as you see fit. You can also lead by example and show your users what’s possible.&nbsp;</p><p>While we work on making a policy setting available to tenants, this feature will be enabled by default (except in EDU). If there are concerns, please contact support.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We can't wait to see what announcement backgrounds you and your team come up with.&nbsp;<br></p>",
