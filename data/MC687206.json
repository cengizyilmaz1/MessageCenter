With private line, users will be able to have a private second phone number that they can make available to a select set of callers to call them directly, bypassing delegates, admins, or assistants. Inbound calls to the private line will be distinguished by a unique notification and ringtone. The private line will support incoming calls only.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=181616\" target=\"_blank\">181616</a></p><p>[When this will happen]:</p><p>Standard Release and GCC: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 (previously early December) and expect to complete by late February 2024 (previously mid-December).</p><p>GCC High and DoD: We will begin rolling out in mid-March 2024 (previously early January) and expect to complete by late April 2024 (previously early February).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>\n\n<p>You will have the ability to designate a phone number as a private line for users to take private line calls.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eFlA?ver=78c1\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"designate phone number\"></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eFlD?ver=c5ab\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"private line\"><br></p>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>\n<p>Nothing you need to do to prepare.
