Thank you for your patience.</p><p style=\"\">The OCR Cost Estimator allows customers to estimate the potential cost for using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR  can scan images for sensitive content and is chargeable based on the number of images scanned.<br></p><p>With the launch of the OCR Cost Estimator, customers can now estimate OCR costs without any pre-requisites. This means that customers will no longer be required to set up an Azure Subscription for billing first and can accurately estimate the cost they would have incurred while using OCR.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=160009\" target=\"_blank\">160009</a></p>\n<p>[When this will happen:]</p>\n\n<p>Rollout will begin in late March 2024 (previously late December) and is expected to be complete by late April 2024 (previously late January).</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>\n\n<p>The primary use case is to see the potential cost that you might have incurred while using OCR. \n</p><p>The OCR Cost Estimator will allow you to try out different workload/user and site scope combinations to find the best setting for you to use OCR, and everything is free of cost. You will be able to see breakdown of cost and volume of images in the dashboards. The ability to download reports for the data is also available.</p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1f1k4?ver=6d16\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"different scope combinations\"><br></p><p><img src=\"https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1eYKs?ver=dbb4\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"breakdown of volume\"><br></p>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>\n<p>Login to compliance.microsoft.com and “Start Cost Estimator” under Settings &gt; Optical Character Recognition.\n</p><p>Users with either of the following role groups will be able to start the OCR Cost Estimator.\n</p><ul><li>Compliance Data Administrator\n</li><li>Compliance Administrator\n</li><li>Information Protection\n</li><li>Information Protection Admin</li></ul>",
