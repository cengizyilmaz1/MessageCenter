This functionality is only available for PSLs generated for specific guest users.&nbsp;</p><p>If your tenant has <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b\" target=\"_blank\">Business to Business Invitation Manager (B2B IM)</a> enabled, Whiteboard PSLs can be sent to non-guest users and an AAD guest account will be created for them in your tenant which will allow them to access the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that Whiteboard will respect your OneDrive sharing settings. If your tenant does not allow sharing with guests, then it will continue to prevent sharing in Whiteboard as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>\n<p>Ensure that your tenantâ€™s OneDrive sharing settings reflect the level of sharing you would like to allow to your users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It could be helpful to inform your users of this change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
