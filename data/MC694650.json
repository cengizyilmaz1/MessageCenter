These reported posts are then submitted to a Communication Compliance policy for customers’ designated investigators with the appropriate role-based access control permissions to review and take action if deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>\n<p>Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect business conduct and regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, user names are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.</p><p>To use this feature, please enable Viva Engage conversation reporting. Reported conversations will automatically route to Communication Compliance if a supported license is present in the tenant.\n</p><p>You can access the Communication Compliance solution in the <a href=\"https://purview.microsoft.com/compliance\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.</p><p> \n</p><p>Learn more: \n</p><ul><li>Learn about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/communication-compliance?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Communication Compliance</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/communication-compliance-policies?view=o365-worldwide#user-reported-messages-policy\" target=\"_blank\">Create and manage communication compliance policies | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/report-conversation-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Report a Viva Engage conversation | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li></ul>",
