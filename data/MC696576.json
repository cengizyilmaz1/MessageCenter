You, as a channel owner or administrator can archive a channel you own. By archiving the channel, it will not be available in your and channel members teams and channels list anymore and no more actions will be allowed on the channel like messaging, reacting, commenting, editing etc. In case, you want, you can unarchive the channel as well, by going to manage teams &gt; channels. Team members can hoist the channel in their left rail even after archival.</p>\n<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=123769\" target=\"_blank\">123769</a></p>\n<p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late February 2024 (previously early February) and expect to complete by mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February).</p><p>Worldwide: We will begin rolling out mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February) and expect to complete by early April 2024 (previously late February).</p>\n\n<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>\n\n<p>Channel owners and administrators can now archive channels to avoid any activity on them and can restore if needed.
