<p>Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Users think about which tasks they need to complete, such as creating a survey, inside Microsoft Teams. Soon, app suggestions will be organized by tasks that the apps support as opposed to conventional categories (productivity, project management). As a result, the new categorization will reduce the amount of time users need to spend learning about these apps â€“ helping them to work more effectively.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=122527" target="_blank">122527</a><br></p>

<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard: Rollout will begin in early Apr 2024 (previously early March) and is expected to be complete by early May 2024 (previously early April).
</p><p>GCC: Rollout will begin in early May 2024 (previously early April) and is expected to be complete by early June 2024 (previously early May).
</p><p>GCC High: Rollout will begin in early June 2024 (previously early May) and is expected to be complete by early July 2024 (previously early June).</p><p> </p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>

<p>The task-based app suggestions will be added to the Tabs, Messaging Extension, and Bots in-context Stores.
