<p>Industry trends and feedback from our customers and partners make it clear that today’s businesses demand an intelligent, integrated forms experience that spans devices which InfoPath does not provide. As announced earlier, InfoPath Client 2013 will reach the end of its extended support period on July 14, 2026 (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/infopath-2013" target="_blank">link</a>), and to keep an aligned experience across Microsoft products, InfoPath Forms Service will be retired from SharePoint Online. We’re sending this message to bring it to your early attention to minimize the potential impact on your organization.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Key Points:</b></p><ul><li>Major: Retirement</li><li>Timeline: Starting from July 14, 2026, Microsoft will remove InfoPath Forms Services for existing tenants. </li><li>Action: Review and assess impact</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>After July 14, 2026, users will no longer be able to use InfoPath forms in SharePoint Online.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>To understand how InfoPath is used in your organization, you can run the <a href="https://aka.ms/assessment/infopath" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 Assessment tool</a> to scan the tenant for InfoPath usage. Using the Power BI <a href="https://aka.ms/assessment/infopathreport" target="_blank">InfoPath Report</a> generated by the scanner tool, you can:</p><ul><li>Identify all InfoPath Forms usage in the tenant, per site collection and site.</li><li>Evaluate the recency and volume of usage of InfoPath Forms.</li><li>Understand lists, libraries and content types that use InfoPath.</li></ul><p>We recommend communicating to the impacted site owners/teams inside your organization now, so they are aware of the coming change.
</p><p>For scenarios where InfoPath or InfoPath Forms services are currently being used, we recommend migrating to <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Power Apps</a>, <a href="https://powerautomate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Power Automate</a> or <a href="https://forms.office.com/" target="_blank">Forms</a>.  Please ensure that you allow adequate time for migration of any use of InfoPath/InfoPath Forms Services in your organization ahead of this date, as there is no migration tool provided. Additional instructions on how to migrate can be found in this <a href="https://aka.ms/sp-infopath-update" target="_blank">blog</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Please plan appropriately as there will not be an option to extend InfoPath Form Services beyond the InfoPath retirement date of July 14, 2026.</p>
