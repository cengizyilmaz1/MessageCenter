<p>As mentioned in previous message center posts (MC516263, February '23), Microsoft is retiring Stream (Classic). Some of the retirement dates for Stream (Classic) have been extended. The new retirement date is April 15, 2024. Certain parts of the service will retire sooner unless you take action, so make sure you review the retirement timeline, prepare your users for this change, and start migrating. The successor service Stream (on SharePoint) is currently available for all customers to begin using.  Encourage your users to upload and manage videos in SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and Viva Engage directly.
