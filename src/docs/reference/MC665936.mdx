<p>Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the content below for clarification. Thank you for your patience.</p><p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137" target="_blank">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.<br></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen later in Q3 of calendar year 2024 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 90 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.
</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 90 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.
</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.
</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.
</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>
</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. 
</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. 
</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP will follow closer to the start of Preview.</p>
