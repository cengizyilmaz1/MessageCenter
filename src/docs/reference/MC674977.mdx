<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:`
<p style="">Updated January 30, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Previously, admins could not change the retention period set on existing labels configured to start retention from when items were labeled. This feature will remove this restriction, and the resulting behavior will be consistent with other retention label types.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=153651" target="_blank">153651</a></p>
<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>

<p>Rollout will begin in mid-February 2024 (previously mid-January) and is expected to be complete by mid-March 2024 (previously late February).</p>

<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>

<p>The next time you edit retention labels set to start retention based on when items were labeled, you should see the ability to update the retention period as below:&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1br8Y?ver=8001" style="width: 400px;" alt="update retention period"><br></p><p><b>Insert Image</b></p>

<p>This change will now provide greater control over retention labels set to start retention from when items were labeled and ensure user experience is consistent with other retention label types.  
</p><p>You will also have the ability to update retention period via cmdlets just like in other retention label types.</p>
<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>
<p>There’s no need for you to do anything to receive this change. However, we recommend reviewing your existing retention labels set to start retention from when items were labeled and update their retention period if required.&nbsp;</p>
