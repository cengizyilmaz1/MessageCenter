<p>Microsoft Teams control messages are system-generated artifacts that contain information about actions taken in Teams - for example, adding or removing a user from a chat. These messages show up on the Teams client as system messages. More information on these types of messages can be found here.</p><p>Currently control messages generated while adding or removing a member to a chat or Team, within Teams chats and Teams Channels (Standard Private, Shared) locations were included in the supported types of messages for retention policies for Teams.
</p><p>We are pleased to announce an improvement to add support for retention and deletion of more types of Teams control messages using retention policies for Teams ("Phase 2”). The additional types included are as follows:
</p><ul><li>Chat renamed
</li><li>Team renamed
</li><li>Team description changed
</li><li>Rename Channel and Channel Description
</li><li>Channel added
</li><li>Member role updated to/from Owner
</li><li>Channel deleted
</li><li>Start/Stop sharing channel with a team
</li></ul><p>Note: “Channel” includes Standard, Private, and Shared Channels.</p>
<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>

<p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out in mid-November and complete in early December.</p>

<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>

<p>These specific types of Teams control messages will now be governed per the rules specified in your Teams user chat and Teams channel messages retention policies. This inclusion happens automatically, no changes are required to your configuration.</p>
<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>
<p>No action is needed to enable this change; however, you may want to communicate this change to the team responsible for Data Lifecycle Management at your organization.</p><p>Additional Information <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/retention-policies-teams?view=o365-worldwide#whats-included-for-retention-and-deletion" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
