<p>Microsoft Loop is a co-creation app which enables you and your team to bring all the parts of your project together in one place and collaborate across the apps and devices you already use.</p><p>We're excited to share that the Loop mobile app now supports Intune app protection policies. This update applies to both iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p>

<p>Available now</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p>

<p>Starting in November, the Microsoft Loop app will be available to target in the Intune console and can be added under <i>All Apps</i> or <i>All Microsoft Apps</i>. To target a policy to only Loop, select the <i>Select public apps</i> option and select Loop.
