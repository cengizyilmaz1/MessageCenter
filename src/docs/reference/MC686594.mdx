<p>To search or export the audit log, administrators or members of investigation teams must be assigned to at least one of the View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs roles. These roles can currently be assigned either through the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal or through the Exchange Admin Center. Starting   February 2, 2024, Microsoft is simplifying Audit permissions management by ensuring you can manage access to Audit in accordance with your other Purview permissions controls directly from the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal. The ability to manage Audit permissions from Exchange Admin Center will cease to be available starting February 2, 2024. We recommend that you start using the Purview Compliance portal to manage Audit permissions and familiarize yourselves with the new permission controls. To minimize impact to your organization, all existing Audit permissions currently assigned in the Exchange Admin Center will be automatically configured in the Purview Compliance portal on February 2, 2024.

</p><p>Starting   February 2, 2024, Microsoft is simplifying Audit permissions management by ensuring you can manage access to Audit within the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal. Starting February 2, 2024, you will no longer be able to manage Audit permissions using the Exchange Admin Center. Any Audit permissions assigned through the Exchange Admin Center on or before February 1, 2024 (existing or new permissions) will be automatically replicated into the permissions tab of the Microsoft Purview Compliance portal on February 2, 2024.
