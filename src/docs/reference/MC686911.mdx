<p style="">Today we’re starting to roll out the <a href="https://adoption.microsoft.com/en-us/new-microsoft-teams/" target="_blank">preview of the new Teams web client</a> to Edge and Chrome browsers.  Our new Teams web client is built on the same foundation as our new Teams desktop clients and brings Edge and Chrome web users new speed, performance, and flexibility when using Teams.
</p><p style=""><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p style="">We have begun rolling this out now.&nbsp;</p><p style=""><b>How this affects your organization:</b></p><p style="">How will this benefit my organization:
</p><p style="">Our goal for the new Teams web app is to bring a near-identical experience to our new Teams desktop app. Both the new Teams web client and desktop clients share the same underlying infrastructure built to improve load times, improve channel and chat switches, and reduce memory usage. 
</p><p style="">Web users will see the same <i>Try the new Teams toggle</i> as desktop users, except the web experience requires no additional download or installation.
</p><p style=""><b>Note:</b> Not all customer segments (Education, Special Cloud, GCC, GCC-High and DoD) will receive this update at this time. 
</p><p style="">While the new Teams on web preview includes nearly all the same functionality as classic Teams on web, tenant switching is temporarily unavailable. This feature will become available shortly.
