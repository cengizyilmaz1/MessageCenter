<p style="">Updated January 30, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Teams Compose is the heart of collaboration, where all Teams messages flow each month. It's also the gateway to a wealth of features, from Copilot to Files, Loops, Video, and Platform Apps.&nbsp;</p><p style="">While Teams' capabilities have grown by leaps and bounds, the compose experience has remained largely unchanged. This update addresses usability, scalability, and information density challenges. We've simplified the compose experience, enhancing usability for various rich authoring scenarios, establishing scalable patterns for all compose actions, and optimizing it for your everyday needs. Get ready to enjoy a more seamless and efficient collaboration experience! This is for the new Teams experience only.</p>
