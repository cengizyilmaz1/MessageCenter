<p>Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Virtual appointment, Webinar, and Town hall are Teams meeting templates that are accessible via the 'New meeting' dropdown menu in Teams Calendar App. We are now expanding how you can access these meeting templates by adding them to the meeting templates menu in the Outlook Windows client in the Teams Meeting Add-In. When in Outlook Calendar, select the dropdown menu next to the Teams meeting Add-In button to see the list of meeting templates now available. When  a meeting template has been selected, the Teams App will open via a deeplink and directly open the meeting template scheduling form.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=181621" target="_blank">181621</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out early December and expect to complete by mid-March 2024 (previously mid-February).</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This will add another entry point for users to access the virtual appointment, webinar, and town hall meeting templates from.
