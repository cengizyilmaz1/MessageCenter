<p>Catch Up allows you to stay in sync with your collaborators in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Web by showing you the latest comment activity that is directed at you and a summary of recent changes. Based on your feedback, we made improvements to the Catch Up feature. The comment activity directed at you will now persist in Catch Up between sessions for up to 28 days. New items will be indicated with a blue dot for clarity. You can also dismiss items individually if you do not wish to keep them in Catch Up.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=184359" target="_blank">184359</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Preview: This is currently rolling out and expected to complete by mid-December 2023.</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out early January 2024 and expect to complete by late February 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This feature today allows end users of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on Web to identify new collaborative activity directed at them such as mentions, tasks assigned to them, and replies to their comments.
