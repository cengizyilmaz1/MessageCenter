<p style="">Updated February 19, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank your for your patience.</p><p style="">Currently, users with Microsoft 365 licenses can view projects shared with them by users of Microsoft Project for the web. This update will enable Microsoft 365 users to collaborate with Project users by editing shared projects.<br></p><p>The added capabilities will enable them to access any functionality where Microsoft Planner and Microsoft Project for the web overlap. For any non-overlapping fields, a Project license will still be required. For example, a Microsoft 365 user can edit the task name, its priority, and its start date. To edit or create a dependency, they will need a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/project/compare-microsoft-project-management-software" target="_blank">Project license</a>. More information on the additional capabilities offered to Microsoft 365 users will be available in our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/project-online-service-description/project-online-service-description" target="_blank">service description</a>&nbsp;following the feature rollout.&nbsp;</p><p>This capability is specific to projects that are created within the default environment, such as by using project.microsoft.com. For information about how to turn off this functionality through the admin center, read <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/project-for-the-web/remove-project-from-the-office-365-app-launcher" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=186228" target="_blank">186228</a></p>
<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p>

<p>This update will begin rolling in mid-February 2024 (previously mid-January) and is expected to complete by late March 2024 (previously late February).</p>

<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>

<p>With this update, Microsoft 365 users in your organization can now edit projects that are shared with them.</p>
<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>
