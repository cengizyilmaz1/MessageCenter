<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:`
<p style="">Starting mid-January 2024, users will be able to pick a folder when saving attachments to their system in the new Outlook for Windows. Previously, all attachments downloaded were saved to a default local folder, which users could not change. This meant that if users wanted to move the file to a specific location, they would have to perform multiple clicks to get to the folder where the file was saved and then move the file to the desired folder.
<br></p><p style="">
</p><p>Now, when a user saves one or multiple attachments a file picker will open to allow the user to access, browse, and save files directly to their desired location on their system.</p><p>This change is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=167892" target="_blank">167892</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>
</p><p>We will begin rolling out mid-January 2024 and expect to complete by February 2024.<br></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>This feature is designed to streamline the process of saving attachments, reducing the number of steps and making it more efficient.
