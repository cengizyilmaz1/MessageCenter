<p>Updated January 19, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>With the new sync window, users can choose how many days' worth of emails and attachments they want to download to their iOS or Android device so they can always access them even while offline.</p><p><b>Note: </b>The emails/attachments will be stored internally as a cache since every time a user changes their sync window (decrease) we do a clean-up of all saved data. They cannot choose the location for that matter.</p>
