<p>Updated December 11, 2023: We have updated the content below to show as intended. Thank you for your feedback.</p><p>We will be making changes to Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) features in Excel.</p><p><b>Note: </b>If you donâ€™t use Power Query, you may dismiss this message.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b><br></p><p>Starting <i style="">March 11th, 2024,</i> we will be introducing important changes to the Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) features in Excel.</p><p><b>How does this affect your organization:</b>
</p><p>Any user who tries to use Power Query after March 11th, 2024, and falls under one of the scenarios, below, will receive a relevant error message.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;As we are modernizing the Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) experience in Excel for Windows, some of the Get &amp; Transform Data capabilities will require <i>Microsoft Edge WebView2</i> (<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge WebView2 | Microsoft Edge Developer</a>) to be installed on the client machine. In the future, all the Get &amp; Transform Data features in Excel for Windows will require Microsoft Edge WebView2 hence we recommend installing this library now.
</li><li>&nbsp;In addition, and to provide the best-in-class encryption to our customers, we are planning to deprecate the support of <i>TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.1</i> or lower in Get &amp; Transform Data (aka Power Query) on all platforms. If a certain external data source a user tries to connect to <i>only supports TLS version 1.1 or lower,</i> they will not be able to access the relevant data source via Get &amp; Transform Data tools in Excel.</li></ol><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>
</p><p>You will need to:
</p><ol><li>&nbsp;<i>Install Microsoft Edge WebView2 run-time&nbsp;</i>for upcoming Get Data features.
</li><li>&nbsp;Ensure all of the <i>external data sources</i> you use with Power Query <i style="">support TLS version 1.2 or higher </i>- for Power Query, in general.</li></ol><p>Please Inform your helpdesk and update documentation as appropriate.
