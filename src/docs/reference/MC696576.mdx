Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">For a paused or completed project where owners want to preserve channel content, but no longer want to keep the channel active, they can archive channels now!<br></p><p>Archiving channels will be available for Teams users. You, as a channel owner or administrator can archive a channel you own. By archiving the channel, it will not be available in your and channel members teams and channels list anymore and no more actions will be allowed on the channel like messaging, reacting, commenting, editing etc. In case, you want, you can unarchive the channel as well, by going to manage teams &gt; channels. Team members can hoist the channel in their left rail even after archival.</p>
