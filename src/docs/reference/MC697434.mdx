<p>Updated January 19, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, users go through multiple steps, selecting between options while creating teams. However, most users are inclined towards setting up their team from scratch and as private. Hence, we defaulted to a simpler experience, yet giving users the rich options of creating a team from a template or group and selecting privacy/sensitivity of the team. It is a simple by default, power on demand experience.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=163364" target="_blank" style="">163364</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early January 2024 and expect to complete by mid-January 2024.</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by late February 2024.</p><p>GCC: We will begin rolling out in early March 2024 and expect to complete by late March 2024.</p><p>
