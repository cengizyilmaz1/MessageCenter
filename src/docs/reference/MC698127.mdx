<p>Microsoft Teams is governed by the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern" target="_blank">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> and requires users to stay on the most up-to-date version of the client application. Automatic updates ensure that users have the latest capabilities, performance and security enhancements, and service reliability.
</p><p>Microsoft is constantly investing into innovations and improvements for more effective, reliable, and secure communication infrastructure. The latest improvements for chat messaging scenarios are enhancing the resiliency of message delivery in Microsoft Teams.
</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b></p><p>By the end of March 2024, Microsoft will stop supporting the legacy services infrastructure for chat messaging.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>
</p><p>Users on Teams clients that are more than three months old may experience delayed chat messages, including one-on-one chats, group chats, or channel posts after March 2024. This change will affect Microsoft Teams Desktop, Teams on Mobile (iOS and Android), and VDI (Virtual Desktop Interface) clients.
</p><p>This change will not affect Phone Devices, Panels, Meeting rooms, or Surface Hubs. The Web version is also automatically kept current.
