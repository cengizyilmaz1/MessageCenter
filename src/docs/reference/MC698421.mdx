<p style="">Updated January 24, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">The current Content Explorer Export feature has a limitation of exporting data only after drilling down to specific location. The new feature coming to General Availability will allow admins to use a new cmdlet within the Security and Compliance PowerShell, Export-ContentExplorerData, to export all rows of data for the content that are scanned and shown on Content Explorer.</p>
