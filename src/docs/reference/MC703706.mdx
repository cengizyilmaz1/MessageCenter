<p>We would like to inform you that the Microsoft 365 Purview eDiscovery standard search-mailbox cmdlet is being retired. Originally announced in 2020, this was postponed as this cmdlet has been a valuable tool for searching and exporting mailbox data for legal and compliance purposes. However, as we continue to improve and enhance our eDiscovery capabilities, we are moving to other means of providing similar functionality.
</p><p>Please note that after the deprecation date, the search-mailbox cmdlet will no longer be supported, and you will need to evaluate other options to meet your requirements.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>
</p><p>Retirement will begin on March 1, 2024 and be completed by late March 2024.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>&nbsp;</p><p>Evaluate use of the cmdlet in your organization and review alternatives to meet key requirements. Validate that the alternative methods will meet your requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><ul><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/new-compliancesearch?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank">New-ComplianceSearch</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-legacy-retirement#search-mailbox-cmdlet" target="_blank">Search-Mailbox cmdlet</a></li></ul>
