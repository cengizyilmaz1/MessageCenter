<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=375640" target="_blank">375640</a></p>

<p>Standard Release: Rollout to GA will begin mid-January 2024 and complete by the end of January 2024.</p>

<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>

<p>Communication Compliance is introducing a new template dedicated to analyzing all Copilot for Microsoft 365 prompts and responses, to help ensure content prohibited by customers’ policies, such as harassing or threatening language, is not being used in Copilot for Microsoft 365 interfaces. In addition, administrators are also able to select Copilot chats as a checked location in the policy creation wizard for any new or existing policies. This empowers administrators to fine-tune their management strategy precisely to their organization’s needs with a focus on user privacy protection. Whether it is setting specific conditions or deploying trainable classifiers, this feature provides flexibility and adaptability in compliance management, ensuring your organization's communications remain secure, compliant, and respectful of user privacy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

<p>Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance provides the tools to help organizations detect business conduct and regulatory compliance violations (e.g. SEC or FINRA), such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content. Built with privacy by design, usernames are pseudonymized by default, role-based access controls are built in, investigators are opted in by an admin, and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.&nbsp;</p>
