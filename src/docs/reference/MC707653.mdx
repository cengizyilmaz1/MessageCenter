<p style="">Coming soon, Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management will be rolling out public preview of progressive alert scoring.<br></p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=179883" target="_blank">179883</a><br></p>

<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Rollout will begin at the end of February-2024 and is expected to be complete by end of March-2024&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p>

<p>With this new feature, user activities that could potentially result in data security incidents will be assessed more frequently within a 24-hour period compared with the current practice of once every 24 hours. Alert insights will now be updated every few hours with this increased frequency, providing analysts with timely alerts and continuously evolving insights.</p>
<p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p>
<p>No action is needed for this update.</p><p>Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.</p><p>You can access the Insider Risk Management solution in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p>https://purview.microsoft.com/compliance</p><p>
