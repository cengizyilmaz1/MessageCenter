```
<p>Starting April 2024, Microsoft Teams will be retiring the ability to load websites inside the new Teams client when using the Website tab. These website links will open in a new browser tab instead. This is to better align with emerging best practices in web security and privacy while also improving the reliability of websites opened through this feature.
</p><p>Please note that EDU tenants will not be impacted as we are still researching options on how to best provide a non-disruptive way to access websites for students and educators at a later date.</p><p>
</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>
</p><p>We will begin rolling out this change in early April 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>
</p><p>Users will no longer be able to view websites inside the new Teams desktop and web clients when using the Website tab and will instead be opened in a new browser tab. Existing Website tabs will also be opened in a new browser tab. 
</p><p>The Teams mobile apps will not be impacted.</p><p>
</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>
</p><p>If users wish to view web content inside the Teams client, encourage users to pin corresponding app tabs instead of pinning their URLs as website tabs. ex: pinning a SharePoint page using the SharePoint app tab instead of pinning the URL using the Website tab.</p>
