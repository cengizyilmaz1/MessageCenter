<p style="">Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">With automatic tags, your frontline workers can reach each other by department or job title in Microsoft Teams channel conversations. Anyone on the team can use the tags in @mentions to notify the people who are associated with the tag.<br></p><p>Your frontline can quickly and easily reach the right groups of people. Because the tags are automatically created based on your mapped attribute values, team owners do not have to manually create and assign tags or manage them locally.</p>
