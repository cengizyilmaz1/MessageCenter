<p style="">When using Microsoft 365 apps on Android for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, files with sensitivity labels will also apply those labels to Adobe Acrobat PDFs created in those apps.
</p><p style="">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=363449" target="_blank">363449</a>.</p><p style=""><b>When this will happen:</b>
</p><p style="">Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by mid-March 2024.
</p><p style=""><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>
</p><p style="">Users who have configured sensitivity labels in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents will see those same labels in PDFs created in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for iOS. Users who try to convert a protected Office document to PDF must first remove the encryption protection (if they have the rights to remove it).
</p><p style=""><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>
</p><p style="">Learn more in the <i>PDF Support</i> section of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#pdf-support" target="_blank">Manage sensitivity labels in Office apps | MS Learn</a>.
</p><p style="">No action is needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>
