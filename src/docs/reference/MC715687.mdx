<p>We are adding new fields in Microsoft Exchange to help prevent data loss. With these updates, admins can see more details about the attachments that are present in the email that violated the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) rules, including name, size, and labels. There will be new fields for the attachments that are in emails when they match a DLP rule that will be displayed in Activity Explorer, DLP Alerts, and Microsoft Theft Protection (MTP) Alerts. With these updates, you can get better insights into the violation that has occurred even before you start getting into the finer details of the issue.</p>
