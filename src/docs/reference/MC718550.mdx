<p>New features are coming to conversation analytics in Microsoft Viva Engage! By the end of March, users will notice a new look for analytics on their posts. Conversation analytics will refresh faster with real-time updates, the expanded set of reactions will show in the reactions breakdown, and users will be able to filter activity across various time periods (7 daysâ€“12 months).  These updates will be available to all customers with a Microsoft 365 license. Additional capabilities like sentiment analysis and more detailed engagement breakdowns will be available only to customers with a Viva Suite or Viva Employee Communications and Communities license.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=168625" target="_blank">168625</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>
