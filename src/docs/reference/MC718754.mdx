<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html:`
<p>We are announcing the retirement of the ApplicationImpersonation Role Based Access Control (RBAC) role in Exchange Online.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will begin the retirement in May 2024 and in February 2025 will remove this role and its feature set from Exchange Online.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>You are receiving this message because this RBAC role is commonly used with Exchange Web Services (EWS) to enable one-to-many mailbox access. We are removing this feature and will begin blocking the assignment of the ApplicationImpersonation (RBAC) role to accounts.</p><p>This will require all apps to have an App Registration, use Application permissions (not Delegated), and use a secure credential for access. Despite this change, if your app is granted the <i>full_access_as_app</i> Application permission, it will provide the same level of mailbox access as the ApplicationImpersonation RBAC role.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>Review your current configuration and make changes as appropriate to minimize disruption to your service.</p><p>For more information, please see:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aka.ms/ApplicationImpersonationDeprecation" target="_blank">Retirement of RBAC Application Impersonation in Exchange Online</a>.</li><li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/impersonation-and-ews-in-exchange" target="_blank">Impersonation and EWS in Exchange</a></li></ul>
