<p>Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 is an intelligent risk reduction tool that allows customers to run realistic phishing attack simulation scenarios in their organization, identify vulnerable users, and help drive behavior change through an integrated security awareness training program. Using the 'copy simulation action' button, Attack simulation administrators will be able to effortlessly duplicate existing simulations and make necessary edits to introduce fresh and tailored simulation scenarios.</p>
