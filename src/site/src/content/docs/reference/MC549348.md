<p style="">Updated January 24, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Emails for Webinars are critical to engage with registrants and often organizers feel the need to customize the content. To enable this,&nbsp;we are rolling out two features.&nbsp;<br></p>
<ol><li>The content of the emails (i.e. all webinar related attendee emails) can be edited by the event organizers. This is reserved for Teams Premium licensed organizers.&nbsp;</li><li>Time to send reminder emails can be configured by the event organizers. This is reserved for Teams Premium licensed organizers.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>
