<p style="">Updated November 30, 2023: We have updated the timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">The animated background feature in Teams Meetings allows users to replace their existing background with a dynamic animation for a more immersive virtual environment. It offers various options to enhance meeting experience with creativity and personalization according to users' preferences. Currently, only pre-defined backgrounds from Microsoft are supported. Animated backgrounds are identified by the small video icon in the bottom-left corner of the preview picture. &nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=122513" target="_blank">122513</a><br></p>
