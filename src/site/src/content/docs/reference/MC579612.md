<p>Updated January 5, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>With privacy and security restrictions, we have implemented a user-level IT admin policy for admins to choose whether some or all users in the company can use Collaborative Annotations. Currently, there is a way to turn Annotations ON or OFF through cmdlet <code><code>Set-SPOTenant-IsWBFluidEnabled</code></code>, this will also influence Whiteboard.</p><p>This change is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=92502" target="_blank">92502</a></p><p></p>
<p>[When this will happen:]<br></p>

<p>We will begin rolling out in early August 2023 and expect to complete rollout by late January 2024 (previously early December).</p>

<p>[How this will affect your organization:]<br></p>
