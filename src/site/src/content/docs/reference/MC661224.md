<p style="">Updated February 25, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Channel meeting invitations will now allow channel meeting organizers the ability to share invites on personal calendars of all channel members.</p><p style="">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=142405" target="_blank">142405</a></p><p style="">
</p><p style=""><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p style="">We will begin rolling out in mid-September 2023 (previously late August) and expect completion by early March 2024 (previously mid-February).&nbsp;</p><p style=""><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p style="">Often, channel meetings get missed since users are not appropriately notified about them. With the added enhancement, meeting organizers can turn a toggle button on the scheduling form when scheduling a channel meeting. Once the toggle is turned on and meeting is saved, all channel members will be notified of the meeting on their main work calendar.&nbsp;</p><p style=""><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p style="">There is no action needed to prepare for this change. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p><p style="">
