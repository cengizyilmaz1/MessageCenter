<p style="">Updated January 2, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Organizers can soon publish the recording of their webinars and automatically send an update to their attendees, in which they will receive a link to watch the on-demand recording hosted on their event page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=123052" target="_blank">123052</a></p>

<p>[When this will happen:]<br></p><p>We will begin rolling out in late September 2023 (previously late August) and expect to complete rollout by late January 2024 (previously mid-December).&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>The organizer would have the ability to pre-approve the recording prior to publishing it for attendees to view. This provides the opportunity for the organizer to either publish the default recorded event or upload their own custom video from their personal OneDrive.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW18zFM?ver=6c63" style="width: 400px;" "alt="publish" webinar="" recording="" view"=""><br></p><p>Additionally, the organizer can also customize and preview the attendee notification prior to sending it out. Once sent, the attendees would then receive a link in their event invite and email to watch the on-demand recording on the event page.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW18CkF?ver=441d" style="width: 400px;" "alt="webinar" recording="" hosted="" on="" event="" page="" view"=""><br></p><p>
