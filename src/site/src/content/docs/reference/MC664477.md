Last updated: 

<p style="">Updated December 11, 2023: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Currently, you cannot see your recently accessed Planner plans or Microsoft To Do lists in your Microsoft 365 homepage. With this update, you will be able to see and access all your recent plans and lists alongside your Microsoft Project for the web projects, Word documents, PowerPoint decks, and more on office.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=149272" target="_blank">149272</a></p>
<p>[When this will happen:]</p>

<ul><li>This update will begin rolling out in late January 2024 (previously early November) and is expected to be completed by late February 2024 (previously late November 2023).</li></ul><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>

<p>With this update, your organizationâ€™s plans and lists will be visible from the office.com home page as opposed to solely from Planner and Microsoft To Do apps. This means you will be able to open your plans and lists directly from the Microsoft 365 homepage, just as you are able to open your Project projects, Word documents, Excel sheets, and all other Microsoft Office files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p>
<p>There is no action required to prepare for this change.  Plans and lists for users in your tenant will begin to appear on the Microsoft 365 homepage as soon as the rollout reaches your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
