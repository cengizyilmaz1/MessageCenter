<p style="">Updated February 8, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">Organizers can set up events and effortlessly add external presenters, who will receive exclusive Teams join links. These links enable external presenters to directly enter the event, eliminating the need for organizers to manually admit them from the event lobby or modify their event role during the session. This creates a hassle-free event experience for organizers and presenters!<br></p><p>External Presenters are considered people outside of your organization, including guests (AAD/B2B/non-AAD), federated, unfederated, and anonymous users (non-AAD). 
</p><p>This feature is available for webinars only. This is <u>not</u>&nbsp;a Teams Premium feature.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=123149" target="_blank">123149</a></p><br><p></p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1bkSL?ver=a18f" style="width: 400px;" alt="external links to join"><br></p>
<p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out late October and expect to complete by early November.</p><p>GCC: We will begin rolling out late November 2023 (previously late October) and expect to complete by late February 2024 (previously late January).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p>

<p>We suggest updating your internal documentation to include this new feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The email template that external presenters will receive will look like the template below.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1bkSI?ver=f4f7" style="width: 400px;" alt="event link"><br>
