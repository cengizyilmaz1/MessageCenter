<p>Updated January 9, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are excited to announce a new feature that will allow individuals to customize the apps on the left navigation on microsoft365.com. This feature will give individuals more control and flexibility over the apps they use and access frequently.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin rolling this feature out in early October 2023 and will complete by late March 2024 (previously late January).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>As part of this feature, the current set of default apps on the app bar will be removed and users will be presented with an experience allowing them to pin the specific apps they want. Users will be able to add and remove apps to the left navigation from the Apps page at Microsoft365.com/apps. Admins will not be able to manage or override the user's app choices.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1c8cr?ver=36ce" style="width: 400px;" alt="pin apps"><br></p><p>
