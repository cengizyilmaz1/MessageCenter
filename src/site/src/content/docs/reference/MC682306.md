<p>Updated February 7, 2024: We will be releasing audience targeting support on Resources component and inline expansion of dashboard component on Viva Connections page. These features are expected to be available to customers by mid-February 2024."</p><p>To prepare for this upcoming release, we recommend setting up revamped Resources section ahead of time as per the instructions shared in our previous update.
</p><p>As part of this update, the Resources section will be updated, and it will be pulling data from a different source other than global navigation. To prepare for this upcoming release, we suggest Connections admins to follow the steps outlined below.: </p><p>The refreshed Viva Connections landing experience offers a more intuitive layout and introduces several requested new features including branding capabilities, sending announcements, a revamped <i>Resources</i> section, and support for different card sizes.
