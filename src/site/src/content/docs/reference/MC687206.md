<p style="">Updated November 30, 2023: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">We are introducing a new calling feature. With private line, users will be able to have a private second phone number that they can make available to a select set of callers to call them directly, bypassing delegates, admins, or assistants. Inbound calls to the private line will be distinguished by a unique notification and ringtone. The private line will support incoming calls only.&nbsp;</p>
