<p>We are excited to announce that Microsoft Search Analytics reports in the Search &amp; Intelligence Admin Center have been updated with improved user analytics! We have expanded coverage to almost all search applications, including Outlook, Teams, and Windows Search! Other improvements provide deeper insights and filtering capabilities for search adoption across search applications and user segments like geography, department, and occupation. The goal is to give you a good insight into adoption of search and to identify adoption gaps for specific search applications, geographies, or departments.<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=177894" target="_blank">177894</a>.</p><p><b>When this will happen</b></p><p>We will begin rolling out early November 2023 and expect to complete by late November 2023.&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization</b></p><p>You will have a better opportunity to analyze search adoption and search activity in regions, departments and occupations across all your search applications. Query Analytics is available in the Search &amp; Intelligence Admin Center and require Tenant Admin, Search Admin or Search Editor roles.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider using the new user analytics to:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Validate key metrics for users who searched, returning users and users with no search activity. What is the potential in addressing users with no search activity?</li><li>&nbsp;Check the user engagement. Is it as expected?</li><li>&nbsp;Check the distribution of search activity across all search applications. Where do you have gaps in search adoption?</li><li>&nbsp;Visit the user analytics detail page for more insights and use the filters to identify adoption gaps. What search application, region or department are lagging in search adoption? Would awareness or training help?</li></ul><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1ey96?ver=f2a1" style="width: 400px;" alt="Microsoft search analytics in the admin center"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare</b>&nbsp;</p><p>The changes are already applied, and you can find more information about Usage analytics <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/usage-reports" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
