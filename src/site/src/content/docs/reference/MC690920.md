<p style="">Updated January 12, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">The new Shared display mode provides users the ability to extend their Teams meeting via a pop-out view-only version of the stage onto the TV screen in BYOD meeting rooms.  This mode ensures the meeting content is always extended to the front of the room for others to see. This gives the host of the room the peace of mind their desktop is for their viewing only, giving them the flexibility to multi-task or work privately on their host desktop.</p>
