Last updated: 

<p>Updated December 11, 2023: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Play My Emails is a feature in Outlook Mobile that allows users to listen to new messages in their Focused Inbox and changes to their day hands-free through a voice-driven experience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin rolling out the update in early January 2024 (previously early December) and expect to complete by late January 2024 (previously early January).&nbsp;</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>After this update, Play My Emails will no longer attempt to prioritize which messages are read out first. Messages will be read out solely based on chronological order.&nbsp;</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>
