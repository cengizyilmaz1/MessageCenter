<p>We are introducing a new people experiences category in Adoption Score in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The new category helps organizations understand the adoption of Microsoft Copilot features in Microsoft 365. This AI assistance category includes a score on a 100-point scale to help track the overall adoption of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365. This score for the AI assistance category will be available in preview and will not impact the overall Adoption Score.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=185700" target="_blank"><font color="#000000" style="">185700</font></a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Preview: We will begin rolling out late November 2023 and expect to complete the rollout by early December 2023.</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out early March 2024 and expect to complete by early April 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Organizations will see a new category in the Adoption Score in Microsoft 365 admin center.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1f4oF?ver=7fb1" style="width: 400px;"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>
