<p>Updated January 2, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.&nbsp;</p><p>Viva Goals Admins or IT admins can mandate that objective and key results (OKRs) should always have a team assignment.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out early January 2024 (previously late December) and expect to complete by late January 2024.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Viva Goals administrators and IT administrators will have new controls in the Viva Goals admin portal to mandate team assignments for OKRs. When this control is turned on, users should assign a team to the OKR while creating them failing which they will be shown an error. This feature will be helpful if your organization does not want users to create individual OKRs and prefers to have only team OKRs.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1f28S?ver=97b8" style="width: 400px;" alt="OKR project and creation"><br></p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>There is nothing needed to prepare.</p>
