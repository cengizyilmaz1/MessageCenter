<p style="">Today, users can see Outlook contacts created with their Entra ID (AAD) account in Teams, but contacts created in Teams are not available in Outlook. To provide a consistent experience we are making changes to allow Teams contacts, created with a user's&nbsp;Entra ID (AAD) account, to be visible in Outlook as well.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin rolling out in mid-December 2023 and complete by late January 2024.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization]<br></p><p>Once this change is complete, users will be able to see created contacts across both Outlook and Teams and vice versa.<br></p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]<br></p><p>You may consider updating your training and documentation as appropriate.</p>
