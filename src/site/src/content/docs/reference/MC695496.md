Details: 

<p>We are excited to share some upcoming updates to the user app request feature in the Teams Admin Center aimed at enhancing the request administration process. Here are the key changes:<br></p><ol><li>User Requests Tab: A new 'User Requests' tab is now available on the App Details page. It provides detailed information about each request, including the requesterâ€™s name, email, job title, and request date, allowing for more informed decisions about app approvals.
</li><li>Dashboard Widget: A widget on the main Teams Admin Center dashboard now shows the most requested apps, giving a clear view of user preferences and helping you prioritize app management tasks.
</li><li>Improved App Request Browsing: The 'Browse by app requests' filter has been added to the 'Manage apps' page, making it simpler to view app requests by demand.</li></ol><p><b>When this will happen:</b>
</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out early December 2023 and expect to complete by early February 2024.</p><p>
</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>
</p><p>These enhancements are intended to simplify your workflow and are only applicable to the administrative side of the Teams Admin Center. The end-user experience and the feature's On/Off status remain unchanged. If the user app request feature was turned off via PowerShell, it will stay off.</p><p>
