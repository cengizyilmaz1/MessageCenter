<p>Updated January 19, 2024: We have updated the timing of this change below.</p><p>We will soon release an updated Company Portal for macOS (v.5.2401.0) that is a required app update. Starting on <b>February 2, 2024</b>, or soon after, the minimum supported version of the macOS Company Portal will change to v.5.2401.0.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p><b>User impact:</b> Most users have app updates set to automatic, so they receive the updated Company Portal app without taking any action. Users that have an earlier app version will be prompted to update to the latest Company Portal app and will need to update to continue using the app.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>No action is needed, but if you have a helpdesk, you may want to make them aware of the prompt to update the Company Portal app.
