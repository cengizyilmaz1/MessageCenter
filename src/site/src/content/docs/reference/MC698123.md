<p>Updated January 12, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are excited to announce that we are rolling out a new report in the Teams Admin Center that will provide basic analytics for external access. This report will allow admins to view information about external access.</p><p>The external access analytics report will be available soon in the Teams Admin Center under Analytics &amp; reports &gt; Usage reports. We hope that this report will provide admins with more visibility and control over external access in their tenant and enable them to make informed decisions about cross-tenant collaboration.</p>
