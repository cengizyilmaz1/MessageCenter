<p style="">Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p style="">We are bringing users a personalized channel feed from people and topics users care about. Instead of going through each channel listed to catch up on what's happening in the org, users can come to Discover Feed in Teams to catch up quickly on relevant channel conversations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Users can see why a specific channel post is being shown in their feed and they can also customize their feed preferences by selecting "Do not show post from X person/channel".&nbsp; Users can also give direct feedback if a post seen on the feed is useful to them or not.&nbsp;</p>
