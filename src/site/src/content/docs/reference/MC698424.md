Last updated: 

<p>You can now rename the Topic Center site address from SharePoint Admin Center. You will use the same flow that you do now for changing the site address. You can also use the PowerShell, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/start-spositerename?view=sharepoint-ps)" target="_blank">Start-SPOSiteRename</a> to make the change. Previously, the site address update could only be completed by making a request to Microsoft Support.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin rolling out early December 2023 and expect to complete by early January 2024.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>There is no end-user impact for this change.&nbsp;</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>You do not need to prepare for this change since the flow for changing the Topic Center site address is the same as changing the site address for any other SharePoint site.</p>
