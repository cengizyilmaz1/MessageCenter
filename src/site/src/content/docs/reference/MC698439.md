Last updated: 

Beginning February 2024, Microsoft Power Apps is introducing a new endpoint for the Power Platform API as a service dependency change in all clouds: *.content.powerplatform.com. The Power Apps end-user experiences will leverage this new endpoint. This change has been reflected in the documentation <a href="https://aka.ms/5866Link1">Power Platform URLs and IP address ranges</a>.<br><br>
<b>What action do I need to take?</b><br>
If you employ in-house firewall rules to restrict network traffic to various URLs or IP addresses, you may need to adjust them to allow traffic to flow to endpoints under the following domain <b>*.powerplatform.com</b>.<br><br><b>Why is this action needed?</b><br>
Depending on your firewall configuration, you may experience service interruptions if this endpoint is not allow-listed. Please review the <a href="https://aka.ms/5866Link2">full, updated list of endpoints</a>.
