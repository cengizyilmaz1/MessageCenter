Last updated: 

<p>In late January 2024, we are updating the name of the service plan used to manage commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot to increase clarity:
</p><ul><li>Current name: Copilot</li><li>New name: Commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot</li></ul><p>[When this will happen:]
</p><p>Timing:
</p><ul><li>Late January 2024: The service plan name will change from “Copilot” to “Commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot” <ul><li>The part name remains: Bing_Chat_Enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><p>[How this will affect your organization:]
</p><p>Only the service plan name is changing. The service plan will continue to allow you to enable or disable commercial data protection for your eligible users when they are signed in to Copilot with their work or school accounts (Entra ID).
</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]
</p><p>No action is required.
</p><p>For further details, please see our technical documentation: <a href="https://aka.ms/Copilot/Docs" target="_blank">Copilot documentation.</a></p>
