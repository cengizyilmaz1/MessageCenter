<p>In late January 2024, we are updating the name of the service plan used to manage commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot to increase clarity:
</p><ul><li>Current name: Copilot</li><li>New name: Commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot</li></ul><p><b>When this will happen:</b>
</p><p>Timing:
</p><ul><li>Late January 2024: The service plan name will change from “Copilot” to “Commercial data protection for Microsoft Copilot” <ul><li>The part name remains: Bing_Chat_Enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>

</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>
</p><p>No action is required.
