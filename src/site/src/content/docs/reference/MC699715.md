<p style="">Updated January 19, 2024: <i>Known issue:</i> Mac users may experience an issue where changes to device selection in the Mac operating system are not reflected in Teams. A temporary workaround is available by manually selecting the desired device within Teams using the audio and video flyouts or panels. This issue will be fully resolved by early February.</p><p style="">Audio and Video flyouts in Teams enable users to efficiently manage their audio and video settings during meetings. These features are easily accessible, allowing users to control their devices and adjust key audio and video features quickly and effortlessly, without needing to navigate through multiple layers of settings.<br></p><p>Users can access this feature in 3 ways:
</p><ul><li>During a meeting, you can access the audio flyout and video flyout by clicking the split button with a downward arrow right next to 'camera' and 'microphone' in the meeting toolbar.
</li><li>From both the audio and video flyouts, you can access audio settings and video settings, which open as panels on the right side of the calling window. You can access these settings by clicking 'more video options' and 'more audio options' at the bottom of the flyout to open the side panel.
</li><li>Users can also access 'audio settings' and 'video effects and settings' by clicking the 'more' menu in the meeting toolbar:
<ul><li>Audio settings: “More” menu &gt; Audio settings
</li><li>Video effects and settings: “More” menu &gt; “Video effects and settings”</li></ul></li></ul>
