Last updated: 

<p>We are excited to announce that Viva Learning now enables admins to tag content with interests to enhance recommendations and search relevance and also enables admins to export content metadata for offline review and analysis of the tags on content.</p><p><b>Note</b>: If you organization is not using Viva Learning you can safely disregard this message.</p>
<p>[When this will happen:]</p>

<p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-December 2023 and expect to complete by mid-January 2024.</p>

<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>This capability enables admins to tag content across different content providers consistently in Viva Learning with the same interest taxonomy curated by admins, enriching content metadata to enhance relevance.
</p><p>Through feature access management, admins can delegate access to content owners, enabling content owners to tag their respective content.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1fPXC?ver=ce94" style="width: 400px;"><br></p><p>
