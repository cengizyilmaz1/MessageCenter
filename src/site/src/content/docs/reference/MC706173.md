<p>Updated February 16, 2024: Additional documentation is now available here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/office/sharing-files-folders-and-list-items-e923c4f0-89f5-4cf0-8948-391e31fc0b30" target="_blank">Sharing files, folders, and list items</a>&nbsp;</p><p>We are updating the Send Email experience with a new Invite flow instead of sending sharing links. We have received feedback indicating that customers who use the Send Email flow perceive they may have overshared when they realize after clicking on the “Send” button that the default sharing link was broader than they had initially intended. This change helps to better align with customers’ expectations when sharing files with others, helping them share confidently with specific people in the most secure ways.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out early January 2024 and expect to complete by late January 2024.</p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out late January 2024 and expect to complete by early March 2024 (previously early February).</p><p><b>Note:</b> Some users may see this feature before others in your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Users who interact with the Share control will be able to see this updated experience across all Microsoft 365 apps and in Web, Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>When you open the Share experience across any Microsoft 365 apps you can now focus on core sharing tasks: Invite and Copy link.</p><ul><li>Invite allows you to grant direct access to your file for the specific people you choose.&nbsp;</li><li>The name, group, or email you add in the “To:” field will receive an email invitation to access this item. Only the people you add or those with existing access can access this invitation.<p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gvVy?ver=f305" style="width: 400px;"><br></p></li><li>The copy link section now returns a success banner with the link scope when the link successfully copies to clipboard. If you wish to modify the link type prior to sharing with others, you can go to the link settings gear icon which moved down next to the Copy button as these settings only apply to the sharing links.<p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gtjR?ver=c586" style="width: 400px;"><br></p></li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>There is no action required from you at this time. We recommend making your users aware of this upcoming update and to follow the tutorial available in the Help button in the Share control.</p>
