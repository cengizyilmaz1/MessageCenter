<p>Currently the scheduling form in Microsoft Teams does not show the time zone or work hours of the attendees, which can make it difficult for users to find a common time to schedule a meeting. A new feature will address this issue by allowing meeting organizers to see the time zone for all meeting attendees in the scheduling form of the scheduling assistant.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=123963" target="_blank">123963</a></p>
