Last updated: 

<p>We are excited to announce that Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Teams chat and channels will soon preserve your side pane preferences for a specific chat thread while the Microsoft Teams app is running. This means that if you open Copilot in one group chat, it will remain open when you return to that chat thread. This feature will be available on desktop and web.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Standard Release: We will roll out this feature to commercial tenants in early-February 2024 and expect it to be completed by mid-February 2024.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>Prior to this feature, when you opened Chat Copilot or Channel Copilot and navigated away and then came back, Copilot would be closed. As a result of the release of this feature, when you open Chat Copilot and Channel Copilot and navigate away and come back, Copilot will remain open. To close Copilot, deselect the Copilot icon.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1gmb8?ver=e2ae" style="width: 330px;"><br></p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]<br></p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.
