<p style="">End users will now be able to change their external call routing settings directly from the Teams app, allowing them to decide how incoming PSTN calls are routed. Calls can be redirected based on existing unanswered call settings or sent to voicemail. This new capability provides more flexibility for handling customer communications.<br></p>
<p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=372120" target="_blank">372120</a></p>

<p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>No direct impact as feature is default OFF by policy, if you want your users to get this feature then enable the feature from policy.&nbsp;</p>
