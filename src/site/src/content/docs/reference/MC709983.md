Last updated: 

<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the reliability of cmdlets, we are replacing the existing two cmdlets of advanced delivery policy with two new cmdlets. The new cmdlets are already available to use.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will be rolling out this change in late January 2024</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>This change will not affect the functionality of the cmdlets. However, if you are using the existing cmdlets to make changes to your advanced delivery policy, they might soon not work. We recommend that you replace those cmdlets with the new ones to ensure uninterrupted service.</p><ul><li>Old cmdlet: <i>*-PhishSimOverrideRule</i>, New cmdlet: <i>*-ExoPhishSimOverrideRule</i></li><li>Old cmdlet: <i>*-SecOpsOverrideRule</i>, New cmdlet: <i>*-ExoSecOpsOverrideRule</i></li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>To prepare for this change, we recommend that you start using the new cmdlets as soon as possible.
