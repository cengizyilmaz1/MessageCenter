<p>Registration form questions are an integral part of setting up a successful webinar. You can add predefined or custom questions to ask your event registrants. Prior to this update, registration form questions had to be added in the order in which you want them to appear on the registration page. With this update, you can add any and all questions to your registration form and then change the order of these questions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=376970" target="_blank">376970</a></p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out late February 2024 and expect to complete by early March 2024.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Webinar organizers can now change the order in which their webinar registration form questions appear after adding them.&nbsp;</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There is no action needed to prepare for this change.
