<p>Updated February 16, 2024: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Content camera support will be available on the new Teams app experience for Windows and MacOS. Content camera enables remote attendees to get a clear view of physical objects like whiteboards, printed documents, books, and more that are in a meeting room. Content camera intelligently detects, crops and frames the in-room object and shares its content with remote meeting participants. Even when a presenter moves in front of it, for example the whiteboard, remote participants will be able to see the content right through them.</p>
