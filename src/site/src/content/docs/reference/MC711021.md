Last updated: 

<p>We have made some changes to system generated emails from SharePoint workflows and alerts display names.<br></p><p>To align system generated emails with best practices, SharePoint Online workflow and alert emails will be displayed as “SharePoint Online”. There is no change to the underlying sending email address, no-reply@sharepointonline.com.&nbsp;<br></p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>If your users have Outlook rules or other processes surrounding the email display name only, those will need to be updated accordingly. Existing policies and rules utilizing the email address will not be affected.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re calling the "SendEmail" API or calling SharePoint workflow or alert services via CSOM or REST API’s those emails will follow the new display convention as well.&nbsp;</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>Inform users of the potential change in their workflow and alert processes from SharePoint.</p>
