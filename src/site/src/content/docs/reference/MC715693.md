After the event is created, the organizer can access this chat before/after&nbsp;the event from the Town Hall Scheduling form, the Teams Calendar, or the event's Details page. Presenters (and external presenters from guests and federated tenants) can access this chat before/after&nbsp;the event from the Teams Calendar or the event's Details page. This chat will appear in their chat pane.&nbsp;During&nbsp;the event, organizers, presenters, and external presenters (including anonymous presenters) can access this chat from within the in-meeting chat by selecting the tab for Organizers and Presenters.</p>
