<p style="">Microsoft SharePoint Embedded, currently in Public Preview, is an API-only solution empowering app developers to leverage the file and document storage in Microsoft 365 to create line-of-business or multitenant applications. Microsoft Loop is an example of a SharePoint Embedded application.
</p><p style="">Organizations who are using SharePoint Embedded applications on their Microsoft 365 tenants are the consuming tenants. With this rollout, alongside PowerShell, consuming tenant admins have the added ability to manage SharePoint Embedded applications registered in their tenant directly through the SharePoint admin center. To access this functionality, administrators must assign the new SharePoint Embedded Administrator role when it becomes available in early March 2024 in the Microsoft 365 admin center. New Embedded Administrators must log in to the SharePoint admin center.
