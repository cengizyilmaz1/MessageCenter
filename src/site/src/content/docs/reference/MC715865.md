Last updated: 

We are introducing a new version of the service health issue details screen in Microsoft 365 admin center. This screen appears when you click on an incident or advisory on the service health page in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
<br><br>
<b>How does this affect me?</b>
<br>
We will begin rolling out in mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by early March 2024.
<br><br>
The new version of this screen substantially reduces the amount of duplicated text and brings key information forward with improved formatting. This gives you quicker access to the information you need and can reduce the time and effort required to get up to speed on service incident details. Admins who view service health information will notice different formatting and layout for service health issues and advisories.

<b>What do I need to do to prepare?</b>
