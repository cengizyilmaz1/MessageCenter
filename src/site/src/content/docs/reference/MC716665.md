<p>The Microsoft Exchange admin center (EAC) is launching new troubleshooting workflows to help customers resolve common issues more efficiently. </p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Standard Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2024 and expect to complete by late June 2024.</p>

<p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b><br></p><p>Admins will be able to access the new <i>Troubleshoot </i>option on the left navigation of the Microsoft Exchange admin center. When common issues arise, admins can run the <i>Quick fixes</i> workflow or <i>Collect logs </i>workflow to investigate. These workflows gather logs and data to provide relevant information, making troubleshooting easier. All logs and data are stored on the admin’s local machine for easy access.</p><p>The <i>Quick fixes</i> option includes workflows to resolve known issues. Each workflow provides detailed information about the actions it performs and the specific issue it addresses.  In this initial release, admins will be able to quickly reset Outlook on the web (OWA) settings for users, helping to resolve various login and calendar-related issues.
</p><p>The <i>Collect logs</i> workflows can be used to diagnose issues with resource mailboxes functioning in unexpected ways or meetings updating incorrectly for a mailbox. Each workflow executes multiple cmdlets and provides aggregated information, which is then downloaded to the admin’s local machine as logs. These logs can be used to diagnose issues independently or provide additional information before contacting Support.</p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hqtx?ver=c7f0" alt="admin screen" style="width: 400px"></p><p><img src="https://img-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/cms/api/am/imageFileData/RW1hGgM?ver=713a" style="width: 400px" alt="admin controls"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p>
