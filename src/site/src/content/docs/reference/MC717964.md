Last updated: 

<p>In Microsoft Teams Admin Center (TAC), we are introducing a feature update to the export functionality for External Domain Activity reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, this report was not exportable. Now, the report can be exported to .csv files where admins can view and manipulate the raw data so that they can show the data to other stakeholders in their organization, visualize the data, write scripts based on the data, and more.</p><p>
