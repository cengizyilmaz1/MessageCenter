Last updated: 

<p>In Microsoft Teams, we are introducing custom avatars for group chats. Group chat members will be able to upload their own image or select a built-in image or emoji, to add a layer of inclusivity and expression to their chat as well as helping visually identity chats with similar titles or participants.</p>
